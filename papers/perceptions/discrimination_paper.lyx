\begin_layout Standard
Farmers rate several agro-input dealers and agro-input dealers are rated
 by several farmers.
 The resulting unique structure has some characteristics of panel data:
 there are multiple observations per farmer but also multiple observations
 per dealer.
 These repeated observations for farmers can be used to exploit variation
 within raters, and the repeated observations for dealers can be used to
 exploit variation within ratees.
 Furthermore, there is variation between farmers and between dealers.
 This provides four ways to look at the data: differences within farmers,
 differences between farmers, differences within dealers, and differences
 between dealers.
 Depeding on the research question, the correct within or between dimension
 has to be exploited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, our data differs from panel data as the indices for individuals
 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 and time 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 are interchangeable.
 For instance, each farmer 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 rates several agro-input dealers 
\emph on
t
\emph default
, so that a within (farmers) fixed effects estimator or a between (farmers)
 estimator can exploit differences within farmers.
 Similarly, each dealer 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 is rated by several farmers 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 and one can exploit differences within dealers by means of a within (dealers)
 fixed effects estimator or a between (dealers) estimator.
 A step-wise approach is necessary to correctly estimate and understand
 agro-input dealer's and farmer's gender effects.
 Hereinafter we explain which questions the different estimators answer
 and how the various estimators are related.
 We elaborate what we can learn from each model and what can we learn from
 looking at all models together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Question 1: Do farmers discriminate against female agro-input dealers? (Agro-inp
ut dealer's gender effect)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Between dealers model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most obvious way to look at the effect of an agro-input dealer's gender
 on his or her rating is to compare the average ratings of male and female
 dealers.
 A male dealer's seed quality is rated 3.46 on average, while a female dealer's
 seed quality is rated 3.37 on average.
 The mean general dealer rating is 3.80 and 3.67 for male and female dealers
 respectively.
 While this shows that female dealers get lower ratings than their male
 competitors on average, it does not imply that female dealers are discriminated.
 Instead, female dealers could truly be poorer dealers, for example due
 to less access to education or training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{F}\underset{f}{\sum}y_{f,d}=\alpha+\beta\frac{1}{F}\underset{f}{\sum}x_{f,d}+\gamma\frac{1}{F}\underset{f}{\sum}g_{f,d}+\frac{1}{F}\underset{f}{\sum}\varepsilon_{f,d}\label{eq:six}
\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{y}_{d}=\mu+\beta\overline{x}_{d}+\gamma\overline{g}_{d}+\overline{e}_{d}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence we compute averages across all farmers 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 who rate a particular dealer 
\emph on
i
\emph default
, which results in data at the dealer level and enables us to look at the
 effect by means of an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
 The dealers' average ratings are regressed on their genders, ie.
 the difference in ratings is estimated conditional on the dealer's gender.
 This between dealers estimator exploits differences between dealers for
 identification.
 However, to estimate discrimination, we need to find out which part of
 the effect is due to male and female dealers differing in quality, and
 which part of the effect is due to farmers rating male and female dealers
 differently while in reality they do not differ, ie.
 farmers discriminating against female dealers.
 The effect of a dealer's gender on his or her rating may be confounded
 by other dealer characteristics like age (female dealers may be younger
 on average, hence less experienced, hence worse dealers), so controlling
 for these variables is necessary.
 Furthermore, we control for various indicators of seed and dealer quality
 like shop temperature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, after controlling for confounding variables and various quality measures,
 we find a significant positive coefficient, the difference in means originates
 from the farmers.
 As quality is controlled for, female dealers would not be worse than their
 male competitors, and the difference in rating would be caused by discriminatio
n against female agro-input dealers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In theory, one could assume that each dealer is rated by all (the same)
 farmers (ie.
 complete panel).
 These farmers would then, on average, discriminate against female dealers.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Farmer fixed effects model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, (unobservable) farmer level heterogeneity may conflate the relationship
 between an agro-input dealer's gender and his or her rating.
 To give an example, a farmer's education level may affect both, how he
 or she generally rates dealers and how he or she rates female dealers.
 Better educated farmers may give higher ratings in general.
 Better educated farmers may also discriminate less, ie.
 give higher ratings to female dealers.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Does this belong here: "They may also be more likely to shop at female dealers,
 ie.
 the dealer's gender is not necessarily exogenous, a farmer's characteristic
 may affect the likelihood that the dealer is female which leads to selection
 bias."?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It is therefore difficult to separate the effect arising from the education
 level of the farmer from the effect arising from gender of the dealer.
 Not controlling for (unobserved) farmer level heterogeneity may therefore
 lead to omitted variable bias and wrong conclusions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the farmer fixed effects estimator uses the fact that the same
 farmer rates both male and female dealers.
 It exploits variation within farmers for identification.
 While we can control for the farmer's education level, this estimator also
 controls for characteristics which would be (almost) impossible to measure
 and to control for like kindness, locus of control, norms and values, etc.
 The farmer fixed effects estimator removes farmer level heterogeneity for
 all attributes that do not vary and remain constant within the farmer,
 regardless of which dealer he or she is rating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{f,d}-\frac{1}{D}\underset{d}{\sum}y_{f,d}=\alpha+\beta\left(x_{f,d}-\frac{1}{D}\underset{d}{\sum}x_{f,d}\right)+\gamma\left(g_{f,d}-\frac{1}{D}\underset{d}{\sum}g_{fd}\right)+\left(\varepsilon_{f,d}-\frac{1}{D}\underset{d}{\sum}\varepsilon_{f,d}\right)\label{eq:four}

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is why we include a regression with farmer level fixed effects (ie.
 we include dummies for all farmers or redefine variables as deviations
 from farmer level means).
 In contrast to the previous between dealers model, we now have repeated
 ratings of the same farmer 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 for 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 different dealers.
 Adding dealer level controls deals with confounding variables and quality
 measures like before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, after controlling for confounding variables, quality measures, and everythin
g that remains constant within the farmer, we find a significant positive
 coefficient, the difference in means originates from the ?.
 The difference in rating would be caused by discrimination against female
 agro-input dealers (?).

Does this model control for discrimination at farmer level, ie.
 does it only explain dealer level heterogeneity (the same farmer rates
 different dealers –> significant differences should be attributed to difference

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Dealer fixed effects model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, one would control for (unobserved) dealer level heterogeneity like
 we control for (unobserved) farmer level heterogeneity.
 A dealer fixed effects estimator would exploit variation within dealers
 for identification and remove dealer level heterogeneity for all attributes
 that do not vary and remain constant within the dealer.
 It would therefore also remove the true quality (the true rating) of the
 dealer.
 The dealer's gender effect that would be left is the difference between
 male and female ratings which cannot be explained by real quality differences,
 ie.
 all variation should be attributed to the farmers who rate, not to the
 dealers who are rated.
 We could safely conclude that this effect is dicrimination.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, including dealer fixed effects and dealer gender in one regressio
n is impossible because gender does not vary within the dealer, ie.
 the matrix of dealer fixed effects would be perfectly co-linear with the
 dealer's gender.
 Gender remain constant within the dealer, so that the average is the always
 equal to the observation, thus cancels out and dealer's gender will be
 removed from the equation above.

Between farmers model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you have a solution! Because farmers did not rate all input dealers,
 there is variation in the degree to which farmers were exposed to agro-input
 dealers of different genders.
 And so the coefficient we estimate in (3) should be a good alternative
 to the one w$

 e can not estimate in (9).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar story can then be created for the second question (but mind you
 that the variable of interest now varies at the level of the farmer!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
let i denote the farmer and t the input dealer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
so just to check if I am still following: in these regressions, the variable
 of interest is not a dummy, but a measure of the gender composition of
 the average customer of the input dealer, right? And so it says that input
 dealers with a more female client profile generally get better ratings,
 right?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes your interpretation below is correct - those with a largely male customer
 base get worse scores and those that have many women among their clients
 get better scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But for the interpretation: be careful, this is a number between 0 and 1.
 So a 10 percentage point increase in the share of men (eg from 50 percent
 men to 60 percent men) reduces average score rating by 0.0337.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our best guess at explaining variation at this level is thus to use model

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The between-farmer model takes averages over all the dealers that were ranked
 by the farmer.
 The number of observations will thus be equal to the number or farmers
 included in the study (about 3,400).
 The model uses differences between farmers to estimate the parameters.
 A significant coefficient on the gender of the agro-input dealer would
 mean that farmers that rated relatively more male agro-input dealers have
 also relatively higher scores.
 As, at least in theory, the farmers rate the same input dealers, any significan
t difference in how farmers rate input dealers of different genders should
 be attributed to differences at the level of the farmers.

In fact, if this would be a completely balanced panel (all farmers rate
 all dealers), than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{D}\underset{d}{\sum}g_{f,d}$
\end_inset

 below would be the same for all farmers (the share of female input dealers
 in the sample) and the effect would be absorbed into the constant.
 I think that the reason why we can estimate a parameter for a dealer invariant
 effect like dealer gender in a between farmer model is due to the fact
 that we have an incomplete panel.
 This could be something we can use in the paper, but we also need to discuss
 the potential problems with this, that the incompleteness is perhaps not
 random?
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This model requires that the likelihood that the farmer rates a female
 agro-input dealer is uncorrelated with farmer specific unobservable effects.

Note that up to now, we did not estimate this model yet! Note also that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{g}_{f}$
\end_inset

 is not a 0/1 variable, but a variable between 0 and 1 indicating the share
 of female agro-input dealers in the total number of agro input dealers
 that were rated by the farmer.
 So for instance if farmer John rated 2 input dealers and one was female
 it would be 0.5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Question 2: Do female farmers rate agro-input dealers differently? (Farmer's
