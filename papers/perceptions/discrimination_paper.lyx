Gender bias in customer perceptions: The case of agro-input dealers in Uganda
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Faced with incomplete and imperfect information, economic actors rely predominan
tly on perceptions and often base decisions on heuristics prone to bias.
 Gender bias in perceptions favoring men has been found in a wide variety
 of settings and may be an important reason why some sectors remain dominated
 by men and gender gaps in terms of benefits persist.
 Using ratings of agro-input dealers provided by smallholder farmers in
 their vicinity, we test if farmers perceive male-managed agro-input shops
 differently than agro-input shops managed by women.
 After explicitly controlling for quality differences between male- and
 female-managed agro-input shops and including fixed-effects to account
 for farmer-level heterogeneity, we find that farmers rate male-managed
 agro-input outlets higher on a range of attributes related to the dealership
 in general, as well as on the quality of inputs sold by the dealer.
 Our results show that gender bias in customer perceptions persists and
 continues to be a severe comparative disadvantage and an important entry
 barrier for female agro-input dealers.
 Policies and interventions designed to challenge gender norms and customs
 are needed to correct this bias.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of incomplete and imperfect information, economic actors
 rely predominantly on perceptions and use mental shortcuts to make decisions
 using limited data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Reliance on instincts and emotions becomes dominant if it is difficult
 to objectively assess the value of a commodity or service being bought
 and sold.
 However, perceptions and decision heuristics may suffer from a variety
 of cognitive biases such as stereotype thinking and availability bias and
 may be influenced by social and cultural phenomena such as homophily effects
 and prevailing norms and customs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural inputs such as inorganic fertilizers or improved seed varieties
 (high yielding cultivars like open-pollinated or hybrid maize varieties),
 lie somewhere on the continuum between experience goods and credence goods.
 When farmers inspect products at the agro-input shop, they can assess quality
 only superficially from readily observable characteristics such as the
 homogeneity of the seed or by checking if the fertilizer package is intact.
 Even after farmers used the commodity and observed the yield, it may be
 difficult for them to learn about the quality of the seed or fertilizer,
 as many other factors in addition to the input affect yield.
 That is why perceptions and emotions often take the upper hand when farmers
 acquire agricultural inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the difficulty of judging the quality of agricultural inputs,
 several studies note that there is considerable heterogeneity in the actual
 quality of these inputs in the market.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1093/qje/qjx009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 test agricultural inputs purchased in local markets in Uganda and find
 that 30 percent of nutrients are missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize
 seed is estimated to contain less than 50 percent authentic seed.
 Also in Uganda, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "doi:10.1080/00220388.2018.1464143"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 test herbicides and find that the average bottle in their sample is missing
 15 percent of the active ingredient and 31 percent of samples contained
 less than 75 percent of the ingredient advertised.
 While it remains unclear if quality-related issues are the result of deliberate
 adulteration or poor storage and handling, and at what point in the value
 chain quality starts to deteriorate, the resulting uncertainty makes reliance
 on perceptions and decision heuristics more likely

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In traditional societies with strong gender norms and customs, small businesses
 alongside food supply chains are often one of the few options for women
 to earn some money independently from their husbands.
 While rapid urbanization has led to the emergence of fast-food restaurants,
 informal food vendors, who tend to be self-employed women, are still the
 main source of food for most households in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GIROUX2021101997"

.
 And while supermarkets are emerging throughout the developing world, wet
 markets where mostly women sell produce continue to account for most of
 the expenditure on fresh produce in many countries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In Uganda, we find that a surprisingly large share of agro-input shops
 are operated and/or managed by women.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the same gender norms and customs also mean that perceptions may
 be stacked against women if they venture into areas such as agro-input
 provision.
 Farmers, both male and female, may believe modern agricultural technologies
 fall in the male domain.
 Furthermore, agro-input shops primarily deal in seed for semi-commercial
 crops such as maize or rice, as opposed to food security crops such as
 beans or cassava.
 Again, commercial crops are often considered to be the responsibility of
 men, while women are expected to take care of the household food supply

 A case in point is the recent study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ntakyo2022"

\end_inset

 which confirms this traditional stance in the context of smallholder production
 in Uganda.
 The authors find a significant negative impact of a commercialization program
 on women empowerment in crop production and their control over income,
 clearly showing a power shift to men in rural households.
 Hence, we conjecture that female-managed agro-input shops may be disadvantaged
 when farmers form opinions about the quality of services rendered or goods
 sold, deeming women not to be fit for these commercial roles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we test if farmers perceive agro-input shops managed by women
 less favorably than agro-input shops under male management using a unique
 dyadic data set of farmer-dealer links.

The paper builds on earlier exploratory work published in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that looks at gender-related perceptions in Uganda’s maize value chain
 more broadly, and prompted us to formulate a more specific hypothesis and
 collect data to test this using appropriate quantitative methods.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To operationalize perceptions, we asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers,
 on a scale of one to five, on a range of characteristics.
 We then make between-dealers comparisons, explicitly accounting for observable
 differences in the quality of male- and female-managed shops.
 Furthermore, we use the fact that a farmer has generally rated more than
 one agro-input dealer.
 If the same farmer rates both male and female-managed agro-input shops,
 we can exploit this within-farmer variation and control for farmer specific
 observable and unobservable confounders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that farmers generally rate male-managed agro-input shops more favorably
 than shops managed by women.
 The difference in ratings is largest when farmers are asked to rate the
 agro-input dealership in terms of price competitiveness and in terms of
 reputation.
 We also find that the quality of seed from male-managed agro-input shops
 is rated higher than the quality of seed from shops managed by women.
 As the differences in ratings persist after explicitly controlling for
 the quality of the dealerships and the services and products they provide,
 we conclude that gender-biased customer perceptions persist and create
 comparative disadvantages and entry barriers for female-managed agro-input
 shops.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We aim to test if gender related discrimination is present in the way smallholde
r maize farmers in southeastern Uganda perceive agro-input dealers in their
 neighborhood.
 In the wider literature, gender related discrimination is often referred
 to as gender equity bias—behavior that shows favoritism toward one gender
 over another.
 Gender equity bias has been confirmed in a wide range of contexts, usually
 when people are asked to assess the performance of another person.
 Stereotyping and role congruence are often catalysts for distorted perceptions
 and false beliefs about the abilities of groups of people.
 We highlight some of the most important studies that search for systematic
 bias related to the gender of the person being assessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One area where gender equity bias has been studied extensively is in scientific
 publishing using peer review.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1093/qje/qjz035"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 look at differences in rejection rates at four top economics journals.
 They compare male-authored papers to female-authored papers, using citations
 as a noisy measure of quality to account for potential sources of divergence,
 other than gender, between the two.
 They find that editors largely follow referees, resulting in a 1.7 percentage
 point lower probability of a revise and re-submit verdict for papers with
 female authors relative to a citation-maximizing benchmark.
 However, evidence on gender biases in the evaluation of economic research
 remains mixed.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "chari2017gender"

\end_inset

 find no disparity in the acceptance rates of female- and male-authored
 papers for National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) conferences; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.12409"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 do find a significant advantage for male authors being accepted at three
 different European conferences.
 Gender equity bias has also been studied extensively in student evaluations
 of teaching.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "mitchell2018gender"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find that the language students use in evaluations of male professors is
 significantly different from their language when evaluating female professors.
 They also show that a male instructor administering an identical online
 course as a female instructor receives higher ordinal scores in teaching
 evaluations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gender equity bias is studied most extensively in the context of peer review
 processes such as those mentioned above.
 However, the same perceptions surface when individuals decide on who to
 engage with, be it who to work with, who to elect as leaders, or who to
 consult.
 For example, when it comes to hiring decisions, managers must decide based
 on limited information.
 Discrimination in labor markets, including discrimination related to gender,
 has been documented in several studies.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 uses data from an online forum for economists called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 to measure gender bias in discussions about women versus men.
 Gender equity bias is also studied in the context of the wage gap, that
 is, when women appear to make substantially less money for the same work
 than their male counterparts.
 Often, this is also tied to gender equity bias in performance appraisals,
 where (often male) managers’ gendered beliefs and perceptions creep into
 evaluations of their subordinates

 a customer's choice of financial adviser.
 The female advisers’ gender was found to have a negative effect on the

 higher among male respondents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in the agricultural
 sector in particular, we find few studies that look at gender equity bias.

 who study discrimination against female-led SMEs in Turkey come closest.
 Conducting a novel loan application experiment with 77 officers in banks,
 they find that 35 percent of the loan officers are biased against female
 applicants, with women receiving significantly smaller loans than men.
 The authors argue that loan officers may use gender bias as a heuristic
 device given limited information and risk aversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gender bias features so prominently in areas such as scholarly peer review,
 teaching assessments or labor markets, partly because perceptions are made
 explicit in the process, for instance through review reports, student feedback,
 or hiring committees.
 However, in economic transactions, gender biases remain hidden as perceptions
 are never measured.
 As a result, differences in outcomes are often attributed to various other
 causes, such as differences in education or ability between men and women.

Study context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study was conducted in Uganda.
 As in many traditional agricultural societies, women's roles are mainly
 domestic, including housekeeping, child rearing, fetching water, cooking,
 and tending to community needs.
 Strong gender norms and stereotypes about the different capabilities of
 women and men imply that many women shy away from economic activities such
 as cash cropping or post-harvest processing.
 Women do participate to some extent in economic life through marketing
 as owners of small shops or vendors during market days.
 Even though the government signaled a willingness to mainstream gender
 as early as in 1997 with its first National Gender Policy, and women are
 reasonably represented at higher levels of government, norms and customs
 prevent women in most rural areas of Uganda from participating fully in
 economic life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study area comprises eleven districts in southeastern Uganda, and roughly
 corresponds to the Busoga Kingdom.
 We include agro-input dealers located in trading centers and villages as
 well as smallholder maize farmers that live in the catchment areas of these
 key market sheds.
 The dealer sample was obtained by listing all agro-input shops in the area
 during a census, which resulted in 193 dealers.
 We collected information on their characteristics in September and October
 2020.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the census, these agro-input shops were grouped in catchment areas
 based on their location.
 A catchment area is defined as the area that is served by a dealer, the
 area where this dealer's customers live.
 If catchment areas of two or more dealers overlap because these dealers
 operate in the same town or trading center, they are assigned to the same
 catchment area.
 This is done based on their geographical location.
 Using GPS coordinates of the shops, the haversine function constructs an
 adjacency matrix, and shops that are less than five kilometers apart are
 assigned to the same catchment area.
 The 5-kilometer threshold was selected based on a visual inspection of
 the map, the size of an average village and the mean reported distance
 between farmers and dealers.
 The 193 agro-input dealers in Busoga were assigned to 65 catchment areas.
 In some catchment areas, there is a high density of shops, while in others
 there are only one or two dealers.
 On average, there are 2.7 dealers in an area, with a minimum of one and
 a maximum of 18.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each catchment area, we also sampled farmers in proportion to the number
 of agro-input dealers in the area.
 We connected shops to villages by asking every dealer where most of his/her
 customers come from.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If this village was already named by another dealer, the village with the

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Enumerators were sent to these villages and instructed to randomly sample
 ten households that grow maize.
 Consequently, we sampled 1,931 smallholder maize farmers and collected
 information about their characteristics in April 2021.
 To increase the number of ratings, a second round was collected in January
 and February 2022.
 While these ratings were provided by the same farmers, only 1,893 of them
 were found during the second wave.
 These two rounds of surveys constitute the key sources of data for the
 study.
 Note that we only include shops in our analysis if the gender of their
 manager did not change between the first and the second round of rating
 collections.

Descriptive statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: descriptives dealer_bothgender"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 describes the average agro-input dealer included in our study, differentiated
 by gender of the shop manager.
 About 60 percent of managers are male.
 When enumerators approached a shop, they tried to interview the manager,
 i.e., the person who is most knowledgeable about the day-to-day operations
 of the business, inventories, sales, and so on.
 It may be that the shop is owned by one person, but the owner employs another
 person to manage it.
 In 63 percent of the cases, the male respondent is also the owner of the
 shop, while only 47 percent of female managers are also the owner.
 If the gender of the shop manager is different from the gender of the owner,
 the question emerges who's gender affects perceptions of the shop as a
 whole.
 We feel that the person who manages the shop is most visible and as such
 most likely to affect perceptions, therefore the gender of the respondent
 determines if a shop is categorized as female or male-managed in our analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is substantial heterogeneity across shops.
 Some are small informal shops located in rural areas, which sell other
 goods and only stock seed during the planting season.
 Others are located in towns or trading centers and specialize in farm inputs
 and tools.
 The average shop has been in operation for about five to five and a half
 years.
 We already see signs of potential discrimination when we look at the number
 of customers: Male managers report serving more than 50 customers a day,
 female managers serve only 35 customers per day.
 A shop stocks on average three maize seed varieties.
 More statistics describing seed handling and storage practices, efforts,
 and services of agro-input dealers, are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 in the appendix.
 We see that female managers do not seem to handle or store seed in less
 appropriate ways than male managers.
 In fact, on many measures, female managers appear to do better than male
 managers.

 The average farmer in our sample works on a small farm, with about 3.4 acres
 of land for crop production.
 Half of our sampled farmers indicate that they used improved maize seed,
 i.e., seed of a hybrid or open-pollinated variety, on at least one plot in
 the season preceding the survey, and of the farmers that used improved
 seed, two-thirds obtained it from an agro-input shop.
 However, fertilizer use is low.
 As a result, productivity is also low, with the average farmer harvesting
 only about 500 kg of maize per acre.
 Almost 70 percent of farmers believe that maize seed sold at agro-input
 shops is counterfeit.

Measuring perceptions

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantifying perceptions of the quality of services provided by agro-input
 dealers and of the products they sell—improved maize varieties in particular—is
 central to our analysis.
 To do so, we asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers in the catchment
 area on a range of attributes.
 We broadly categorized the attributes into two families.
 A first set of indicators attempts to measure overall quality of agro-input
 dealers and the services they provide, while a second set of indicators
 has a narrower focus and asks about maize seed, a particular product sold
 by the agro-input dealer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the perceived quality of agro-input dealers, farmers were asked
 to rate these dealers on a scale of one (worst) to five (best) on their
 general quality, location (convenience, accessibility, closeness to clients),
 price (competitive pricing, discounts), seed quality, stock (availability
 of seed, number of varieties in stock), and reputation (what do other farmers
 think about the dealer).
 We also compute an average of these six dealer-level ratings.
 For these indicators, farmers were asked to rate the shop as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the perceived quality of seed, farmers were asked to rate the
 improved maize varieties that dealers sell on a scale of one to five on
 their general quality, yield, drought tolerance, pest/disease tolerance,
 crop duration/maturation period, and germination reliability.
 We also compute an average of these six seed-level ratings.
 Here, farmers were asked to rate the product itself.
 Farmers were also allowed to indicate that they could not rate seed on
 a particular dimension (for instance, because they never bought seed from
 the agro-input dealer).
 Then this dimension was not considered when computing the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers twice, a first time in April
 2021 and a second time in January and February 2022.
 The average farmer in our data set provided ratings for about two agro-input
 dealers, with some farmers rating up to 15 dealers.
 The average agro-input shop received ratings from almost twelve farmers,
 while one shop received ratings from almost 50 farmers.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 provides descriptive statistics of the ratings used in our study.
 For example, when assessing the quality of maize seed sold by male agro-input
 dealers, farmers rate its germination with 3.67 out of 5 on average.
 Farmers generally rate dimensions related to the dealership better than
 dimensions related to the product.
 For instance, the mean location rating is 3.91 out of 5 for female agro-input
 dealers.

\begin_layout Standard
Our empirical strategy exploits the nature of the data, that is, that farmers
 in our data set rate several agro-input dealers (and dealers are rated
 by several farmers).
 A useful starting point is the following specification:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{f,d}=\alpha+\beta g_{d}+\varepsilon_{f,d}\label{eq:base}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{f,d}$
\end_inset

 represents the rating, on a scale of one (poor) to five (excellent), given
 by farmer 
\emph on
f
\emph default
 to agro-input dealer 
\emph on
d
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{d}$
\end_inset

 is the main variable of interest—the gender of dealer 
\emph on
d
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are parameters to be estimated, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{f,d}$
\end_inset

 is a residual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the same farmer may rate several agro-input dealers, we cannot assume
 that the ratings 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{f,d}$
\end_inset

 in equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:base"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) are independent.
 For example, the ratings that a farmer provides may be affected by (potentially
 unobservable) characteristics of the farmer (for example, a poor experience
 with an agro-input dealer in a previous year), which may affect the ratings
 of all agro-input dealers this farmer rates.
 Furthermore, the same agro-input dealer may be rated by several farmers,
 leading to interdependence in the other dimension.
 For example, the ratings that a dealer receives may be affected by (potentially
 unobservable) characteristics of the dealer (for example, dealer friendliness),
 which may affect the ratings given by all farmers that rated this dealer.
 To account for this two-way interdependence in equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:base"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), we define a composite error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varepsilon_{f,d}\right)$
\end_inset

 that can be decomposed into a farmer specific component 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\nu_{f}\right)$
\end_inset

, an agro-input dealer specific component 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega_{d}\right)$
\end_inset

, and a residual 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\epsilon_{f,d}\right)$
\end_inset

 that varies at the level of the farmer-dealer interaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{f,d}=\nu_{f}+\omega_{d}+\epsilon_{f,d}\label{eq:error-component}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:error-component"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) shows that the dyadic nature of our data leads to two-way clustering in
 the error term.
 If the error term is uncorrelated with the explanatory variable(s) included
 in equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:base"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) remains consistent.
 However, not considering within-cluster error correlation generally leads
 to standard errors that are biased downward, leading to under-rejection
 of the null hypothesis that gender does not affect ratings.
 In our case, it should be noted that clustering is non-nested.
 As traditional cluster-robust inference can only deal with clustering in
 one of the dimensions, our strategy will consist of including sufficient
 regressors to minimize concerns about error correlation at the agro-input
 dealer level, and then cluster standard errors at farmer level

To test for an agro-input dealer gender effect, we can simply compare average

not really, this would only be the case if the same set of farmers rate
 all agro-input dealers.
 Can we assume this is the case on average though? Maybe we should put this
 in a footnote.
 Furthermore, it may also be important to note that an OLS on the means
 gives equal weight to each agro input dealer (regardless of how many farmers
 rated the agro input dealer).
 A regression on the dyadic data like equation (1) would result in a cluster
 weighted regression.

It is important to note that in equation (

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\varepsilon}_{d}$
\end_inset

 may be correlated with the independent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{d}$
\end_inset

.
 This would be the case if, for example, female agro-input shop managers
 are less educated on average than male agro-input shop managers, and less
 educated dealers get lower ratings by farmers.
 In this case, differential ratings are not caused by gender, but rather
 driven by differences in education.
 Therefore, in all regressions, we control for the education level of the
 shop manager, and add an additional regressor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{d}\right)$
\end_inset

 to equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 A similar argument can be made for the age of the agro-input shop manager,
 which is a characteristic that is also easily observable and likely to
 affect perceptions

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may wonder if controlling for age and education is sufficient, as causal
 inference using regressions based on observational data often suffers from
 unobservable heterogeneity.
 It is important to note that this is likely to be less of a problem in
 our setting, because the dependent variable is derived from observations
 made by farmers while the characteristics included on the right hand side
 are collected from agro-input shop managers (which is different from the
 standard case where both dependent and independent variables are obtained
 from the same actors).
 For example, it is unlikely that an unobserved characteristic such as the
 motivation of the agro-input manager directly affects perceptions of farmers,
 unless this is reflected in the attribute that the farmer is assessing.
 That is why we also add control variables that differ depending on the
 attribute that is being rated.
 For example, when farmers are asked to rate agro-input dealers in terms
 of price competitiveness, it seems reasonable to include prices charged
 by these dealers as controls.
 Similarly, for perceptions related to the quality of seed sold, we are
 particularly interested in testing if the coefficient on the gender of
 the agro-input dealer changes after adjusting for various observable dealer
 characteristics that are directly related to quality, like the storage
 technology, the infrastructure such as a leak-proof roofing or insulation,
 and so forth.
 This way, we attempt to differentiate between situations where farmers
 perceive female-managed agro-input shops less favorably and situations
 where differences in ratings reflect real differences between male- and
 female-managed shops.
\begin_inset Foot

Deciding which control variables to include is not always straightforward,
 especially for seed quality, which is difficult to verify objectively (which
 is why farmers are likely to rely on perceptions and potential gender differenc
es in perceptions of agro-input shop managers are particularly alarming).
 The decision on what controls to use is based on quantitative and qualitative
 data of different stakeholders (including extension staff, agronomists,
 seed inspectors, and so forth) that was collected prior to the study.
 During the study, enumerators were also asked to provide a detailed assessment
 of seed handling and storage practices and facilities of agro-input dealers.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farmer-level characteristics could also confound the relationship between
 an agro-input dealer's gender and the rating that the farmer provides.
 For example, it may be that farmers who are better educated generally provide
 higher ratings.
 At the same time, imagine that better-educated farmers are more inclined
 to shop at male-managed agro-input dealerships.
 This would make it difficult to differentiate a gender equity effect from
 an effect arising from differences in farmer education.
 Fortunately, we often have instances where the same farmer rates both male-
 and female-managed agro-input shops.
 This allows us to exploit within-farmer variation for identification in
 equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:four"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While we would be able to control for a farmer's education level by simply
 including it in an OLS regression, a within-farmer transformation also
 controls for characteristics that would be difficult or impossible to measure
 and to control for, like motivation, kindness, locus of control, norms,
 and values, and so forth.
 In other words, the within-farmer (fixed-effects) estimator removes all
 farmer-level heterogeneity.

 The difference between the two tables is that in the first table, farmers

, we find that on all but one dimension, male-managed agro-input shops are
 rated higher than female-managed shops, and that the difference in ratings
 is significant for five out of the seven comparisons (at the ten percent
 level).
 We find a particularly large difference when farmers are asked to rate
 price competitiveness.

 male-managed agro-input shops receive a score of 3.44 out of 5.

While these effects may seem small, it should be noted that ratings generally
 lie within a small range (of approximately 2.5 to 4).
 Thus, even a small coefficient estimate may reflect a considerable bias.

 Similar differences exist when farmers are asked to rate an agro-input
 dealer in terms of stock.
 Here, male-managed agro-input shops receive an average score of 3.99 out

 Interestingly, female-managed agro-input shops are not rated significantly
 worse with regards to the quality of seed sold.
 They also appear to be equally rated with respect to location.

 repeats the between-dealers analysis but compares ratings for quality attribute
s of maize seed sold by these dealers.
 While we still find that on most characteristics, male-managed agro-input
 shops get a higher rating than female-managed shops, the differences are
 never significant.
 Note that these results are consistent with what was found in Table

 seed quality.
 This suggests that when farmers are asked to think about a particular product,
 they make abstraction of the person selling it, and the gender effect becomes
 less important.

\end_inset

, which compares general quality ratings given to male- versus female-managed
 agro-input shops.
 We include three relatively objectively observable proxies for general
 dealership quality.
 First, we asked enumerators to provide an overall cleanliness and professionali
ty rating for the agro-input shop for which they collected data.
 Second, we construct an index that measures dealer effort and a range of
 services that dealers offer to clients.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indices were constructed by weighing each component by the inverse covariance
 matrix following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In particular, this index accounts for whether an agro-input dealer 1)
 always explains how seed should be used (seed spacing, seed rate, complementary
 inputs); 2) always recommends complementary inputs such as fertilizers
 and chemicals; 3) provides extension or training on how to use improved
 seed varieties to clients; 4) provides discounts to clients who buy large
 quantities of seed; 5) sells small quantities; 6) provides seed on credit;
 7) has received a seed-related complaint from a customer; and 8) accepts
 mobile money as a payment modality.
 Descriptive statistics for the variables which constitute this effort and
 service index are shown in the appendix in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:descriptives indices-by gender"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, we asked enumerators to carefully observe and note down a range
 of capital-intensive seed handling and storage practices, which we also
 summarized in an index.
 In this index, we account for whether 1) the roof is leak-proof; 2) the
 roof is insulated to keep the heat out; 3) the walls are insulated to keep
 the heat out; 4) the area where seed is stored is properly ventilated;
 5) any official certificates are on display in the shop (for example, inspectio
n certificates, training certificates, registration with an association,
 and so forth).
 Also for these variables which constitute the capital-intensive practices
 index, descriptive statistics are shown in the appendix in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:descriptives indices-by gender"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 We see that after controlling for these three groups of variables, the
 male premium on general quality ratings increases from 0.13 to 0.16.
 Note that the index of capital-intensive seed handling and storage practices
 observed by the enumerator is significant and has the expected sign, as
 input dealers who score better on this index also receive higher scores
 on general dealership quality.

However, caution should be taken when interpreting control variables, as
 they do not necessarily have a structural interpretation.
 For instance, it may be that the relationship between the control variable
 and the outcome variable is confounded by a third (potentially unobservable)
 variable

 the average distance between dealers and their customers,

The haversine formula calculating the arc distance between two points is
 used.
 The latitudes and longitudes are extracted from the GPS coordinates for
 both farmers and agro-input shops and inserted as paired values in the

 The formula then calculates the distances between these paired latitudes
 and longitudes.

 an indication of dealer centrality, provides an obvious candidate as a
 control variable (column (3) in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_dealer ratings_with controls"
plural "false"

 We do not find a gender effect on ratings concerning location in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_dealer ratings_no controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, nor do we find a difference after controlling for centrality.
 It should also be noted that the control variable is significant in the
 expected direction, as dealers for whom the average distance between dealer
 and customer is larger (or centrality is lower) also are scored lower in
 terms of location.

In column (4) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_dealer ratings_with controls"

\end_inset

, we look at price competitiveness.
 To account for the possibility that the difference in price ratings between
 male- and female-managed agro-input shops is driven by actual price differences
, we control for the average price the dealer charges for improved maize
 seed, as well as for the cost at which the dealer obtains seed, an important
 determinant of the price.
 The analysis confirms that there is a difference in perception of male
 and female dealers, and that this difference cannot be explained by actual
 price differences.
 The gender equity effect is larger than the one found without controlling
 for actual price differences in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_dealer ratings_no controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

 Note again that one of the control variables is significant and suggests
 that dealers who charge higher prices also receive significantly lower
 price competitiveness ratings, as expected.

, we control for another index, one that reflects 
\shape italic
all
\shape default
 seed handling and storage practices observed by the enumerator.
 This index includes the five capital-intensive practices mentioned above,
 but also accounts for whether the agro-input dealer 1) destroys seed that
 has exceeded shelf-life; 2) stores seed in a dedicated area, away from
 other merchandise; 3) has no problem with rats, insects, or other infestations;
 4) stores seed in ambient light conditions as recommended; 5) stores seed
 on pallets or shelves; and 6) does not store seed in open bags or containers.
 This index also includes the shop’s overall cleanliness and professionality
 rating provided by the enumerator.
 Descriptive statistics for the variables which constitute this (capital-
 and labor-intensive) practices index can be found in the appendix in Table

In column (6), we repeat the analysis for perceptions related to a dealers'
 stock, now controlling for the number of hybrid maize varieties that this
 dealer has in stock and the quantity bought by the dealer from seed producers
 or wholesalers, the former being significant and having the expected sign.
 The male premium on the rating persists, although the effect becomes slightly
 weaker as compared to a regression without controls (column (6) in Table

, but controls for practices that are expected to improve seed quality.
 As all ratings in this table concern quality, we include the same controls
 in all regressions.
 We use the most elaborate index of all seed handling and storage practices
 as observed by the enumerator that was also used in model (5) of Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Recall from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_seed ratings_no controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that we did not find a gender effect for any seed-quality-related dimension,
 and adding the index to control for quality does not change this.
 Note that the index is generally positively correlated with the ratings,
 but only significantly so when farmers are asked to assess the yield of
 seed that agro-input shops sell.

 This suggests that differences in ratings between male- and female-managed

 rather than actual differences in the dimension being rated (general quality,
 price competitiveness, stock, and reputation).

\begin_layout Subsection
Farmer fixed-effects models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to test whether the male bias persists after accounting for farmer-leve
l heterogeneity, we exploit the fact that farmers generally rated more than
 one agro-input dealer.
 If the same farmer rates both male and female-managed agro-input shops,
 we can exploit this within-farmer variation and control for farmer specific
 observable and unobservable characteristics by including farmer fixed-effects.

 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: FE_dealer ratings_no controls"

, we use the general agro-input dealer ratings as outcome variables, similar

 estimates the same model, but now for the more specific seed-quality-related
 ratings, similar to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_seed ratings_no controls"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the previous subsection, the dependent variable was the 
\shape italic
average
\shape default
 rating received by dealers, leading to a sample size of about 150 with
 one observation per rated dealer.
 In the following farmer fixed-effects analyses however, the dependent variable
 is the rating of a particular farmer given to a particular dealer.
 The number of observations now represents the total number of ratings given
 by all farmers to all dealers with one observation per farmer-dealer combinatio
n, leading to a much larger sample size.

Table

 shows that male-managed agro-input outlets receive significantly higher
 ratings in the areas of general quality, price competitiveness, and reputation.
 The average dealer rating also significantly differs between male and female
 dealers.

, the largest difference can still be found for price competitiveness, even
 though the magnitude of the effect decreased somewhat.
 The effect of gender on ratings related to stocks reduced sharply after
 controlling for farmer-level heterogeneity.

Number of observations: We first stack all ratings by farmers given to dealers
 of both rounds of collection, then exclude ratings of shops if the gender
 of their manager changed between rounds.
 E.g., for Dealer’s location, we collected 837 ratings in the first round
 and 944 in the second round, leading to 1,781 observations included in
 this table, conveying the dyadic nature of the dataset.

, we see that some of the differences between ratings of male and female
 dealers turn significant after controlling for farmer-level heterogeneity.
 For perceptions related to seed germination, male-managed agro-input shops
 receive a score that is on average 0.11 higher than the germination rating
 female-managed shops receive.
 The gender equity bias in this dimension is also reflected in a significant
 difference in the average seed rating between male- and female-managed
 agro-input shops in column (1).

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that we do find gender equity bias when farmers are asked to assess
 seed quality if we control for farmer fixed-effects suggests that, in the
 between-dealers regressions of Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_seed ratings_no controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_seed ratings_with controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, gender equity bias is obscured by farmer-level confounders.
 For instance, it could be that farmers that are higher educated also provide
 higher ratings and that these higher-educated farmers are also more likely
 to shop at female-managed dealerships.
 Not controlling for differences in education levels of farmers may then
 lead to an underestimation of discrimination against female-managed agro-input
 shops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we run a fixed-effects model that, in addition to controlling for
 farmer heterogeneity, also controls for dealer-level observable characteristics
 (see equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:fe_contr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

)), similar to Tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_dealer ratings_with controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: between_seed ratings_with controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: FE_dealer ratings_with controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 presents the more general agro-input dealer ratings, and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: FE_seed ratings_with controls"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 presents the more specific seed ratings.
 We find that controlling for observable characteristics at the dealer level
 does not change the findings for the first set of ratings, which evaluate
 the dealership.
 The largest gender equity effects are found when farmers rate price competitive
ness in column (4) and agro-input dealer reputation in column (7).
 In both cases, male-managed agro-input shops are rated about 0.22 points
 higher.
 The difference in ratings between male- and female-managed agro-input shops
 for the stock attribute has become indistinguishable from zero.

Number of observations: We first stack all ratings by farmers given to dealers
 of both rounds of collection, then exclude ratings of shops if the gender
 of their manager changed between rounds.
 E.g., for Dealer’s location, we collected 837 ratings in the first round
 and 944 in the second round, but for 75 observations control variables
 were missing, leading to 1,706 observations being included in this table.

, the significant difference between male- and female-managed agro-input
 shops with respect to the average seed rating persists after controlling
 for observable dealer-level differences in seed quality.
 The difference in germination ratings in column (7) becomes insignificant
 but we now find a significant male premium for the general seed quality
 ratings in column (2).

Number of observations: We first stack all ratings by farmers given to dealers
 of both rounds of collection, then exclude ratings of shops if the gender
 of their manager changed between rounds.
 E.g., for Seed’s yield, we collected 797 ratings in the first round and 924
 in the second round, but for 236 observations control variables were missing,
 leading to 1,485 observations being included in this table.

\begin_layout Standard
Using survey data from smallholder maize farmers and agro-input dealers
 in southeastern Uganda, we test if farmers perceive female-managed shops
 differently than male-managed shops.
 To do so, we asked farmers to rate agro-input dealers in their neighborhood
 on a scale ranging from one (poor) to five (excellent).
 Farmers rated dealers on a set of general characteristics such as accessibility
 and price competitiveness.
 They also rated maize seed, a particular product that these dealers sell,
 on various dimensions like germination, yield, and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply comparing average ratings given to male- and female-managed agro-input
 shops, we find that shops managed by women are generally rated lower than
 their male-managed competitors.
 However, when farmers were asked to focus on a specific product, the difference
 was insignificant.
 After adding controls for agro-input dealer-level observable characteristics,
 parameter estimates and significance remain similar, suggesting that difference
s in ratings between male- and female-managed agro-input shops reflect differenc
es in perceptions rather than actual differences in the attributes being
 rated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, ratings of agro-input dealers provided by farmers may also
 be influenced by farmer characteristics.
 To control for farmer heterogeneity, we exploit the fact that farmers often
 rated several agro-input dealers of different genders and ran farmer fixed-effe
cts models.
 Doing so, we confirm the existence of gender equity bias when farmers were
 asked to rate general characteristics of agro-input dealers, but also find
 differences in ratings of different dimensions of seed quality sold by
 dealers of different genders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking into the individual dimensions that were rated, we find particularly
 strong gender equity bias when farmers rated agro-input dealers in terms
 of price competitiveness.
 Furthermore, and especially after controlling for farmer-level heterogeneity,
 we find that male-managed agro-input shops to have a significantly better
 reputation than female-managed shops.
 This contrast in reputation is also reflected in a significant difference
 between male and female dealers in the general quality rating.
 On the other hand, we do not find that male- and female-managed agro-input
 shops were rated differently when farmers were asked to consider location.
 This may be because location is easier to assess objectively.
 For attributes related to the quality of seed sold by agro-input dealers,
 gender bias was largest when farmers were asked to assess seed germination
 rates and whether the seed being rated had the advertised maturing period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finding that farmers are discriminating against shops managed by women is
 troubling for a variety of reasons.
 Their biased perceptions can influence real purchase decisions which may
 have long-run implications for agro-input shops.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 indicates that an average female-managed agro-input shop in our sample
 receives only about 36 customers per day while an average male-managed
 agro-input shop receives about 51 customers per day.
 The amount of maize seed sold and the revenue from these sales earned by
 an average female-managed shop are also lower than the amount sold and
 revenue of an average male-managed agro-input shop.
 Farmers' biased perceptions can be particularly damaging in traditional
 agricultural societies with strong norms and customs.
 In these societies, women's opportunities are already severely restricted,
 and gender bias may further restrain women from entering productive activities.
 This will in turn reinforce gender stereotypes and the view that women
 are less able to perform particular tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, gender equity bias does not only directly impact women’s capabilities,
 aspirations, and their empowerment in agri-food systems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It is also likely to affect future generations, as women tend to invest
 more of their income than men in healthcare, nutrition and education of
 their children 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.2307/145670"

\end_inset

.
 But there are consequences that go beyond the household.
 Almost half of the agro-input shops in our sample are managed by women.
 If farmers do not trust these shops, this may pose challenges for varietal
 turnover at more aggregate levels: In a village where only women manage
 shops, farmers may be less likely to buy commercial improved seed from
 the market, and instead use farmer-saved seed obtained through informal
 channels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our finding has important implications.
 It underscores the importance of customs and norms in rural and more traditiona
l societies.
 Interventions and initiatives that focus solely on increasing women's empowerme
nt are unlikely to be sufficient and may in some cases even backfire

 It will be important to challenge gender stereotypes and role congruence
 and such interventions should not focus on only one gender.

\begin_layout Standard
Our study serves to draw specific lessons for policy.
 Over the years, policymakers have encouraged women to enter business domains
 which were traditionally dominated by men, with women striving towards
 new opportunities and ways to earn for their livelihoods or families.
 However, our findings show the need for policies addressing the lack of
 acceptance or integration that still prevails.
 If these biased perceptions cannot be corrected, we may see a withdrawal
 of many women from these sub-sectors in the future as they become increasingly
 aware about the difficulties and the higher likelihood of restricted growth.
 We restrict ourselves to three areas where we see scope for policy action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, even though we do not find evidence of actual differences in quality
 between male- and female-managed agro-input shops, existing training and
 advisory services for agro-input dealers are also likely to be biased toward
 men, and this may indirectly influence perceptions related to the abilities
 of female managers.
 Ensuring that women entrepreneurs have access to training should be a policy
 priority.
 The effectiveness and inclusiveness of training programs depend on many
 attributes of the program.
 This includes more obvious aspects such as the training content and who
 is targeted, but also less obvious attributes such as the gender of who
 provides the training, the timing of training, and so forth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lecoutere2023empowering"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 At the same time, it is also important to change the perception that female-man
aged agro-input shops are likely to receive less training.
 This could be achieved by making training attendance publicly visible,
 perhaps through a register of trained agro-input dealers, through certificates
 that are displayed in the shops, and so forth, such that equal capacity
 between male- and female-managed agro-input shops becomes more apparent
 to clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, female role models have been shown effective in increasing female
 participation in a variety of otherwise male-dominated sectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1257/app.20180426,10.1162/rest_a_01153"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Considering this, perceptions may evolve in line with the presence of women
 among agro-input dealers, inspectors, extension providers, and leaders
 of professional associations such as UNADA.
 This will not only motivate more women to enter the market but also bring
 forth wider acceptance across the value chain and in agricultural markets.
 For public sector positions, quotas may be considered, since research suggests
 that they can be an effective way to challenge gender stereotypes held
 by men 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beaman2009powerful"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we find that biased perceptions exist especially with respect to
 prices charged by female agro-input dealers.
 Simply advertising prices may be sufficient to make them objectively verifiable
, and customers will need to depend less on perceptions and the use of mental
 shortcuts that are prone to gender equity bias.
