 id="x1-30001"></a>General Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >Neoclassical economic theory assumes rational agents to be interacting in a context of full
information. However, in the real world, both consumers and producers face substantial information
frictions. Sometimes agents lack skills to correctly assess information about the counterpart. In
other cases, one actor may strategically decide to hide valuable information. As a result, economic
agents often rely predominantly on perceptions to inform transaction decisions. Similarly in
commodity supply chains, information frictions may exist, especially in informal value chains where
quality is hard to track and agreements difficult to enforce. As a result, value chain
actors also base part of their decisions on perceptions and beliefs about actors up- and
downstream.
<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >Although perceptions provide information to the other actors about the attributes of an individual
seller or buyer in the supply chain, these can have significant consequences for the entire
supply chain, especially if perceptions do not align with reality. False beliefs and incorrect
preference may lead to inefficient supply chains and hamper value chain innovations. More
importantly, systematically biased perceptions may hamper inclusiveness of value chains. For
instance, if traders of a certain clan or tribe are traditionally regarded as good traders,
other actors may hold inflated perceptions. This may result in barriers to entry for other
traders.
<!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >Despite the importance of beliefs and perceptions for transactions within food supply chains, there
are few studies that track perceptions throughout the chain. This is at least partly because
perceptions are not always objectively measurable. However, we cannot ignore the importance of
perceptions as a crossing node for operational psychological preferences and real economic
mechanisms in the markets. These arguments necessitate the study of perceptions in the
agricultural supply chains in detail.
<!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >I study the case of maize value chains in Uganda where ratings are used as a proxy measure for
perceptions and beliefs. I use data from 1,500 maize farmers, 78 input (seed) dealers, 341 assembly
traders, and 174 millers from Eastern Uganda to document (in)consistency in farmer&#8217;s, input (seed)
dealer&#8217;s, trader&#8217;s, and miller&#8217;s perceived attribute ratings of these actors. To investigate
systemic bias along gender lines, I further test if the sex of the rater or the ratee has any
impact on the ratings (perceptions). A representative sample of farmers were asked to rate
up to three dealer(s), trader(s) and miller(s). Then these dealers, traders and millers
were traced and asked to assess themselves in a similar way. I use input dealer, trader
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
and miller attributes, such as perceived ease of access to the dealer, trader or miller,
perceived quality of the seed sold by the dealer or the quality of service provided by the
trader or the miller, and reputation of the dealer, trader or miller, to assess how such
perceived input-dealer, trader, or miller attributes align between value chain actors, and how
(non-)alignment is mediated by sex of the farmer (rater) or the ratee (dealer, trader or
miller).
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >Ratings can be used as a tool to understand what factors determine widespread perceptions about
certain actors in the food value chains. The literature shows that ratings can be used
as an instrument for identifying performance levels of various actors in markets and
industries, for information transparency (<a 
href="#XKarminsky2016">Karminsky and Polozov</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKarminsky2016">2016</a>) and for decision
management. Various rating based decision management studies come from the financial sector,
like credit ratings explaining investment decisions (<a 
href="#XBolton2012">Bolton et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a

the financial crisis (<a

href="#XKliger2000">Kliger and
Sarig</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKliger2000">2000</a>). In marketing research, ratings are the tool to identify demand (<a 
href="#XDhar2016">Dhar and

href="#XCole2019">Cole et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XCole2019">2019</a>). Similarly, ratings can be used to study various
agricultural aspects, providing an understanding of the perceptions of the different value chain
actors. Recently, the study of perceptions has also been applied to food supply chains where
perceptions have been found to correlate to innovations in supply chains and indicate
loopholes in the performance of involved actors (<a 
href="#XOla2020">Ola and Menapace</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#XOdongo2016">Odongo
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XOdongo2016">2016</a>).
<!--l. 233--><p class="noindent" >Broadly, studying the rater&#8217;s ratings and ratee&#8217;s self-assessments can give insights about the deeper
mechanisms of performance perceptions in the value chains. Higher ratings may motivate actors to
sustain performance while lower ratings may lead actors to improve performance or at least induce
increased effort. Although there are various other factors like competition, access to facilities,
knowledge of the business, etc. which can influence the performance levels directly, the fact that
ratings can also drive these factors directly or indirectly cannot be ignored. Ratings can be assumed
as a method of assessment which does not couple with direct repercussions but do successfully
indicate indirect repercussions which impact the rated subjects (in the present or in the
future).
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >Systematic differences in ratings related to gender have been studied extensively and
the literature shows a wide range of studies in different fields on gender based rating
patterns (<a

href="#XPatiar2008">2008</a>). In the
agricultural sector, studies based on sex of the various actors of the food value chains
are becoming more prominent, particularly in the developing economies (<a

href="#XMnimbo2017">2017</a>). For
instance, in Africa, attempts of closing the productivity gap between male and female
farmers is a new step towards achieving food security with gender dimensions in the
food value chains across Uganda increasingly gaining importance in the recent years
(<a

href="#XLarson2016">Larson
et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XLarson2016">2016</a>) showed that improved access to markets and extension services for both male and
female smallholder maize farmers can help reduce the gender productivity gap in Uganda.
These motivate the aim to understand the alignment of perceptions based on the sex of
the farmer, agro-input dealer, trader and miller in the case of maize value chains in
Uganda.
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" >Traditionally, women have not been playing a significant role in the input dealing, processing and
trading activities for maize in Uganda. Thus, analysing how the sex of each actor impacts the
ratings from farmers and the self-ratings is crucial in the Ugandan maize value chain. Systemic
gender bias in perceptions can demotivate the entry of women in the food supply chains, creating
better opportunities for men to flourish in these industries. Issues like discrimination against
women, barriers to market access for women, mistrust, lower credit availabilities, etc. are some of
the consequences of such gender bias in perceptions. Thus, perceptions obtained from this study
can aid in the explanation of why women do not participate as much as the men in
these kind of businesses which fuel the maize value chain and the production of maize in
Uganda.
<!--l. 277--><p class="noindent" >The first objective of this study is to establish how the perceived attribute ratings and self-ratings
of dealers, traders and millers differ from each other. All the actors are studied together
highlighting the ratings being received and the self-assessments. The four attributes, as rated on a
scale of 1-5 by farmers and by the dealers, traders and millers themselves, are: (i) quality
of service provided by a dealer, trader or miller relative to the other dealers, traders
or millers; (ii) price competitiveness assessed of one actor relative to the other actors;
(iii) location (ease of access by road or phone) of the input dealer (trader or miller)
relative to other dealers (traders or millers); (iv) reputation of a given dealer (trader
or miller) relative to other dealers (traders or millers). The second objective aims at
understanding rating patterns based on the sex of the farmer (rater). The third objective aims to
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
understand the self-rating patterns based on the gender of the ratee (dealer, trader, or miller).
The fourth objective is to identify whether farmers score based on the sex of the input
and service providers. The final objective is to study the interaction between the sex of
the rater (farmer) and the ratee (essentially gender related homophily as discussed by
<a 
href="#Xmcpherson2001birds">McPherson et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xmcpherson2001birds">2001</a>)). Average ratings and multivariate regression models are used for the
analysis.
<!--l. 299--><p class="noindent" >This study contributes to the literature that examines the role of agro-input dealers, traders and
millers in facilitating or limiting the development of smallholder agriculture. Ratings for the
different actors of the supply chain, which this study employs to examine farmer&#8217;s perceived
value of input dealers, traders or millers, is widely an used system in marketing as a
mechanism to increase customer trust in and purchase of services/products (<a 
href="#XJayashankar2018">Jayashankar
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XJayashankar2018">2018</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XChiu2014">Chiu et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XChiu2014">2014</a>). Such a rating system, if applied to agricultural input marketing, is
likely to encourage input dealers to desist from counterfeiting, adulteration or deceptive
marketing of inputs in order to maintain a good reputation and higher rating (<a 
href="#XKim2013">Kim and
Park</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKim2013">2013</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBente2012">Bente et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBente2012">2012</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBarIsaac2008">Bar-Isaac and Tadelis</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBarIsaac2008">2008</a>). If applied to assembly
trading, it will ensure broader access to maize markets and good prices for the farmers&#8217;
harvests. Similarly, ratings for maize processing can improve the end products obtained
from maize and can sustain the value chain, ensuring less wastage and good quality of
food.
<!--l. 316--><p class="noindent" >Seller ratings and reputation are increasingly becoming important assets in marketing, particularly
when the quality of the good or service transacted is hard to measure and the buyer
and seller cannot perfectly contract on the outcome of the transaction, or where there
are no legal institutions to alleviate buyer uncertainty (<a 
href="#XBarIsaac2008">Bar-Isaac and Tadelis</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBarIsaac2008">2008</a>).
This significantly ties into the literature on product standards and traceability. Ratings
can be aggregated through crowdsourcing in information clearinghouses, an evidence
of which was given by <a 
href="#XHasanain2019">Hasanain et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XHasanain2019">2019</a>), where a randomized control trial was
used to study the impact of clearinghouse ratings in the context of veterinarian success
in Punjab, Pakistan. Through these type of ratings, the supply chain actors may be
mindful of building and maintaining a good reputation through the information that the
farmers have about these actors, including previous transactions and the reports of other
farmers.
<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" >The findings of this study indicate enhanced (positive) self-perceptions compared to the perceived
attributes of the farmers. Interestingly, the prominence of gender is evident in the farmers&#8217;

 id="x1-40002"></a>Study Context</h3>
<!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >This section discusses the context and background of the study. The case for this investigation is
the maize value chain in Uganda. Maize is a staple crop in Uganda, prioritized by the
government for food security and household income. By land area, maize is the most
cultivated crop in Uganda, covering 30% of the total cropped land, followed by beans,
covering 15% of cropped land. Maize and beans are often intercropped. Government&#8217;s
interventions in the maize sub-sector over the past decade have targeted increasing on-farm
productivity and production, yet productivity remains very low. On-farm maize data from 2018
agricultural year reports (Uganda Annual Agricultural Survey) yield figures of 596 kg per
acre (or 1.49mt/ha); a figure that falls almost midway the yield range of 270 and 995
kg per acre, as reported by <a 
href="#XGourlay2019">Gourlay et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XGourlay2019">2019</a>). While there is some ambiguity in
the on-farm yield figures, partly due to errors in farmer-reported production (<a 
href="#XGourlay2019">Gourlay
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGourlay2019">2019</a>) and differences in the climatic conditions between different agricultural years (<a 
href="#XVanCampenhout2020">Van
Campenhout et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XVanCampenhout2020">2020</a>), they are still considerably lower than the research station
yield figures which range between 730 kg per acre and 1,820 kg per acre (<a 
href="#XFermont2011">Fermont and
Benson</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XFermont2011">2011</a>).
<!--l. 370--><p class="noindent" >Improved maize seed (hybrid and open pollinated varieties) is among the top agricultural inputs
promoted by the government, development partners and private sector to increase maize yields in
Uganda. But, just like the other improved agricultural inputs, the proportion of households using
improved maize seed in Uganda is still low, estimated to range between 27% and 37%, compared to
between 30% and 50% in Tanzania and Malawi (<a 
href="#XVanCampenhout2020">Van Campenhout et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XVanCampenhout2020">2020</a>). When measured
using the percentage of land under improved maize seed, the use rates in Uganda slightly increase
to 54% (<a 
href="#XSheahan2017">Sheahan and Barrett</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSheahan2017">2017</a>).
<!--l. 380--><p class="noindent" >Limited use of improved maize seed is just one among the many factors constraining maize yields in
Uganda. In addition, insubstantial access to markets for harvested maize for farmers living
in remote areas, slow advancement in milling technologies, price discrimination at all
levels of the supply chain, issues of trust amongst the supply chain actors, lower selling
prices of the harvest, quality of services provided by the various supply chain actors and
business ethics in the sector during selling, trading or milling influence maize yields at
large. For instance, several factors at household, market and policy levels constrain the
use of improved maize seed and generally improved agricultural inputs by Ugandan
farmers. Like any other industry, the maize supply chains need to maximize yield gains,
ensure cost-effective sale, storage and production, adhere to improved technologies and
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
increase the usage of improved inputs to increase the profits for all the actors in the
sector.
<!--l. 397--><p class="noindent" >Not only input usage is important in the context of maize supply chains, trading and
processing of maize are equally essential to meet consumption needs across Sub-Saharan
Africa. For instance, <a 
href="#XEkpa2019">Ekpa et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XEkpa2019">2019</a>) discusses the importance of promoting processing
techniques reducing the loss of nutrients, improving nutritional and baking properties and
increasing shelf life. Traders and processors should be aware of the high potential in localized
maize foods, ensuring effective ways to preserve the nutritional components of the maize
crops and fair prices for the maize farmers. A better understanding of these aspects can
be obtained from the perceptions of these value chain actors about their performance
attributes.

<!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >The roles of input dealers, maize traders and maize processors in the maize supply chain are
intricate. Their performance can have major impacts on the entire value chain leading to food
security issues. There is ample evidence of the essential role of improved agricultural inputs,

productivity, poverty reduction, and generally economic transformation (<a

<!--l. 426--><p class="noindent" >Common explanations advanced in the literature are that: farmers are risk averse, or are not aware
of existing technologies, or lack knowledge about their proper use, or are financially constrained, or
lack information about profitability (<a

the limited adoption. Poor quality inputs pose a major disincentive to the adoption of
improved inputs as use of low quality inputs result in low average returns to farmers (<a

<!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >Research and policy have focused on two main explanations for low quality inputs: (i) sellers

an important node for the sustenance of the maize value chains. Although their role
has already been studied with respect to the agricultural innovation processes (<a

href="#XAdhiguru2009">2009</a>), it is essential to realise the perceptions of their performance in the maize supply
chain.
<!--l. 463--><p class="noindent" >Trading of maize is an essential part of the maize value chain. Assembly traders help in the
marketing of maize and thus, are a bridge between the farmers and the markets (or the millers in
particular). Local assembly traders reach the remote locations to collect maize harvests mostly
directly from the farmers at the farm gate, the small rural storage facilities or the markets. These
traders take the responsibility of transportation in general so that the harvested maize can reach
the essential marketing destinations, starting from small retailers, millers or processors, bigger
regional markets to export centers.
<!--l. 473--><p class="noindent" >The assembly traders even play a major role in the storage of the harvest. This can impact the
quality of maize in the supply chain as there can be incidences of contamination and mould (<a 
href="#XKaaya2006">Kaaya
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
and Kyamuhangire</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKaaya2006">2006</a>). While studying market access in Southern and Eastern Africa, <a 
href="#XMather2013">Mather
et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XMather2013">2013</a>) commented that access to assembly traders have increased over time and this has
given greater opportunities to the remote areas in terms of access to maize markets. This claim is
supported by <a 
href="#XSitko2014">Sitko and Jayne</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XSitko2014">2014</a>) with the mention of trading being highly competitive in
Eastern and Southern Africa in terms of the marketing margins and the number of traders
operating. Studying the perceptions of and about these important actors can aid in
the understanding of the marketing linkages, maintenance of quality during trading
activities (storage and transportation) and sustenance of trading relationships in these rural
markets.
<!--l. 487--><p class="noindent" >Another necessary actor of the maize supply chain is the millers or processors who produce the final
product from the harvested maize. For instance, the profit-efficiency of the maize mills has been
studied by <a 
href="#XAbu2009">Abu and Kirsten</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XAbu2009">2009</a>) in South Africa where the researchers indicated the
unexplored potential of the mills due to the deregulation of the maize markets in the
country.
<!--l. 494--><p class="noindent" >Interestingly, the type of maize being milled can be influenced by consumer preferences. An
example of this can be obtained from <a 
href="#Xomueti2006comparison">Omueti et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xomueti2006comparison">2006</a>) where the authors mention that soft
endosperm varieties of maize are preferred in Western Africa because they are easier to process and
thus, finer final products can be achieved from such varieties. Thus, maize millers or processors can
act as a connection between the supply and the demand chains because consumer preferences
can be rooted into the supply chains through the decisions of the maize millers in the
types of maize they buy to process for selling purposes. At the same time, large scale
processors can influence government actions for the sustenance of food value chains
(<a 
href="#Xomueti2006comparison">Omueti et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xomueti2006comparison">2006</a>), indicating the extent to which maize millers hold a prime role in the
maize value chain mechanisms. These arguments help in explaining why studying the
perceptions of milling performances are important to get better insights about the supply
chain.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.2"></a>Perceived Attributes of Supply Chain Actors</h4>
<!--l. 516--><p class="noindent" >Due to limited knowledge and information asymmetries, it is often hard for farmers to
assess the quality of products and services offered by input dealers. Products sold by
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
agro-input dealers such as improved seed varieties, inorganic fertilizer, and pesticides or
herbicides are considered &#8220;experience goods&#8221;. The quality of these goods are hard to
assess ex-ante, and the information advantage of the input dealer may lead to a lemons
market (<a 
href="#XBold2017">Bold et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBold2017">2017</a>). Based on limited knowledge, own experience and the dealer&#8217;s
reputation (information that other buyers have about the seller), a farmer may form
his or her own perceptions about quality of inputs and services provided by the input
dealer.
<!--l. 528--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the quality attribute, farmers may use perceptions and beliefs related to a range of
other attributes of the input dealer. For instance, price considerations and the relative
competitiveness of the dealer will be important when a farmer decides to transact with a particular
input dealer. Primarily, ease of access to an input dealer determines transaction costs and
subsequently farmer&#8217;s access to and use of improved inputs (<a 
href="#XAlene2008">Alene et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XAlene2008">2008</a>). Secondly, ease of
access to input dealers may increase interaction between farmers and the input dealers, thereby
increasing farmers&#8217; learning about improved seed. The theoretical framework motivating a possible
link between input dealer attributes and use of improved seed can be located in the literature on
customer perceived value and consumption behavior (<a 
href="#XJayashankar2018">Jayashankar et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XJayashankar2018">2018</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XChiu2014">Chiu
et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XChiu2014">2014</a>). This literature suggests that (continued) usage of a given product or service is
accompanied by not just a customer&#8217;s perceived value (price or quality) of that product/service,
but also the perceived value (e.g. trust/reputation, accessibility) of the provider of the
product. Thus, the perceptions formed on the basis of price competitiveness, quality of
seeds, ease of access and reputation can determine the use of improved inputs to some
extent.
<!--l. 548--><p class="noindent" >Next, I turn to the perceived attributes of traders. In remote locations, if the traders are
easily accessible, that would mean that the farmers have greater exposure to selling
opportunities, might reduce wastage of harvest, ensure constant income for the farmer and
increase availability of maize harvests at the buying points. Thus, ease of access is likely to
be more important than for instance, quality when assessing traders. Traders having
better reputation will influence the perceived reputation attributes, i.e., if a farmer hears
something good about a trader from another farmer, he or she will perceive that trader to
be well-reputed. Reputation of the trader may also be motivated by trustworthiness
and higher number of business interactions. Traders in greater demand are likely to be
well-reputed.
<!--l. 561--><p class="noindent" >The perceived quality of service can be driven by many aspects like behavior of the trader,
flexibility of the trader, risks taken by the trader for the transportation of the harvest, etc. The
price paid by traders while buying the harvest is an essential part of the interaction
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
between the trader and the farmer. It is very important to know how accurately the
farmers perceive the prices being paid by the traders and how accurately the traders
perceive the prices they are paying themselves. This is an observable attribute of the
trader, so most farmers should agree on their perceptions. However, these perceptions can
have some underlying factors like length of the relationship between the trader and
farmer. For instance, if a trader has been buying maize from a farmer for a long period of
time, the farmer might agree at a lower price because he or she will be ensured that
the harvest will always be sold on time without any hassle. Therefore, these perceived
attributes about the traders can give better insights about access to maize marketing
channels.
<!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >Millers or processors are scored by the farmers based on similar factors or attributes. The location
of the mill is necessary to understand how easy it is for the traders or farmers to take
the harvest to the processing points since in Uganda, both farmers and traders can
take the harvests to the mills. For farmers living in remote areas, it may be hard to
transport their harvest for milling or processing. Thus, location of the mills can influence
perceptions of the farmers about the millers. In addition, perceptions are formed based on the
quality of service and the quality of end product provided by these mills. Better milling
technologies, cleanliness of the mills, transparency at the mills and flexibility provided
by the mill staff can result in good perceived performance levels. Similarly, friendly
behavior and shorter waiting times at the mills can ensure good perceived reputation of the
processors.
<!--l. 593--><p class="noindent" >Perceived prices cannot directly indicate the actual price charged at the mills because perceptions
are not objectively measured or directly observed. High prices may not always be perceived as bad
as they can be coupled with the quality of processing and the quality of the end product ensured by
the mill. This may point towards the provision of price competitiveness among the processors. Finer
end products can improve the perceived quality of end product along with the perceived
reputation of the mill or the processor. Thus, the quality of processed maize available
for the consumers can be partially explained by the perceived attributes of the maize
millers.

<!--l. 628--><p class="noindent" >Hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 1 --></a> determines how the agro-input dealers, processors and traders rate themselves
(self-assessments) compared to the ratings from the farmers. Self-ratings have been criticized
largely and checked for validity by many researchers in different fields of research
(<a 
href="#XHeneman1974">Heneman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XHeneman1974">1974</a>;&#x00A0;<a

href="#XHorwood2021">Horwood and Anglim</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XHorwood2021">2021</a>). This
study does not claim that the self-ratings determine the actual performance levels of the
agro-input dealers, processors and traders in the Ugandan maize value chain. This is
because self-ratings can be a victim of self-bias (<a 
href="#XSui2017">Sui and Humphreys</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSui2017">2017</a>), self-deception
(<a 
href="#Xvon2011evolution">Von Hippel and Trivers</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xvon2011evolution">2011</a>), self-enhancement (<a 
href="#XSedikides2008">Sedikides and Gregg</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSedikides2008">2008</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XAlicke2009">Alicke

href="#XWayne1995">Wayne and Liden</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWayne1995">1995</a>). However,
the self-ratings indicate the perceived level of performance by the service and input
providers which is the main motivation towards the inclusion of this hypothesis in the
study.
<!--l. 643--><p class="noindent" >Perceptions in this regard can explain a lot about the sector and could also explain slower
technological change and advancements. If these service and input providers perceive themselves to
be performing better than they actually are, then there will be lesser efforts to improve their
professional stance in the industry. If the farmers rate the input dealers, traders and millers lower
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
than their self-ratings, it shows that the agro-input dealers, processors and traders are not meeting
the expectations of the farmers without even realizing their perceived low performance
levels. This non-realization is emanated through their more favourable self-ratings. <a 
href="#XCheng2017">Cheng
et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XCheng2017">2017</a>) discusses that more favourable self-assessments can be a result of leniency in
assessing self-performance. Such a leniency creates a gap between the perceived performance
levels from the farmers and the perceived self performance levels of the input and service
providers.
<!--l. 658--><p class="noindent" >Then, I turn to the variations in ratings based on gender (hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70032">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 2 --></a>). There is evidence from
various areas of research that women generally rate more favourably than men. <a 
href="#XFurnham2005">Furnham</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XFurnham2005">2005</a>)
discussed ratings from men and women on business intelligence where women rated boss&#8217;s overall,
emotional and organizational IQ more favourably than the male subordinates. Interestingly,
<a 
href="#XRappoport1993">Rappoport et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XRappoport1993">1993</a>) showed that women tended to assess healthy meals more favourably based
on factors like health, pleasure and convenience compared to men. <a 
href="#XWinquist1998">Winquist et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XWinquist1998">1998</a>) argues
that women have a tendency to score higher because perceptions of women are more positive than
perceptions of men.
<!--l. 670--><p class="noindent" >In this study, it is expected that female farmers will more favourably rate the input dealers,
processors and traders on average compared to the male farmers, i.e., perceptions of female farmers
will be more positive about the service and input providers. This can indicate various
interesting and unknown attributes of the maize value chain. There are possibilities
that female farmers are given better services and inputs by the input dealers, maize
processors and traders, leading to more favourable ratings from the women. This can be
culturally linked for a prominent gender bias in the provision of services and sale of goods.
Another reason for this can be minimal stringency and greater leniency from women while
rating the service and input providers they are involved with in their income-generating
activities. However, the literature does not mention statistically significant presence of
leniency for ratings provided by female raters (<a 
href="#XThorntonIII2019">Thornton III et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XThorntonIII2019">2019</a>). Validating this
in the research of food value chains can be an interesting contribution to the existing
studies.
<!--l. 687--><p class="noindent" >Hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 3 --></a> essentially compares the self-ratings (assessments) given by female and male
agro-input dealers, processors and traders. Women generally tend to underrate themselves, i.e.,
women perceive their potentials to be limited. <a 
href="#XPatiar2008">Patiar and Mia</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XPatiar2008">2008</a>) saw a similar pattern for
female Department Managers in the hotel industry. Male Department Managers always inflated
their self-assessments while the women refrained from doing so. Gendered differences in
self-perceptions do exist and this induces women and men to rate themselves differently, as argued
by <a 
href="#XBeyer1990">Beyer</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XBeyer1990">1990</a>);&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWOHLERS1989">Wohlers and London</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XWOHLERS1989">1989</a>) and <a 
href="#Xrosenkrantz1968">Rosenkrantz et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xrosenkrantz1968">1968</a>). Not only
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
that, <a 
href="#XBraddy2020">Braddy et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XBraddy2020">2020</a>) found that women tend to experience harsher consequences
than men when they overrate themselves. Such gendered ideas of self-assessment can
partially explain why lesser number of female agro-input dealers, processors and traders get
involved in the maize markets in Uganda. Since they underestimate their ability and do
not think themselves to be performing well enough as the men, women could be less
willing to be involved in these kind of business activities. Thus, the maize value chain
remains dominated by the male service and input providers, pointing towards the need
for important policy implications in this sector to encourage greater involvement of
women.
<!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" >Another important reason or consequence of less favourable self-perceptions can be the lack of
confidence to strive in the business. In the developing economies, women generally have low
confidence levels and face a lot of obstacles due to the standard cultural norms, societal
expectations, gender discrimination and job-family conflicts (<a 
href="#XIzhar2006">Izhar</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XIzhar2006">2006</a>). <a 
href="#Xbrown1996">Brown</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xbrown1996">1996</a>)
illustrated this phenomenon for Ugandan women describing how socialization effects, cultural
validation of male dominance and gender stereotyping hinders the advancement of these women in
educational management roles. As a result of social imposition of family roles, Ugandan women
tend to have lower self-esteem and confidence in their potential to succeed outside domestic roles
(<a

href="#XIzhar2006">2006</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbrown1996">Brown</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbrown1996">1996</a>).
<!--l. 720--><p class="noindent" >The goal for hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 4 --></a> is to study the differences in ratings received by male and female
agro-input dealers, traders and processors from maize farmers. One of the reasons behind lower
ratings for women may be that women are generally perceived to be performing worse than men.
For instance, <a 
href="#Xlyness2006">Lyness and Heilman</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xlyness2006">2006</a>) found that female managers received lower performance
ratings compared to male managers. Particularly, women involved in line jobs (jobs
involving physical strain like installation of transmission systems, etc.) received lower
ratings compared to women involved in staff jobs. <a 
href="#Xbasow1987">Basow and Silberg</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xbasow1987">1987</a>) presented
similar findings for female professors who were rated by both male and female students.
Bias against female professors has been very prominent in the literature in the past
decades (<a 
href="#XFeldman1993">Feldman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XFeldman1993">1993</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XMengel2018">Mengel et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XMengel2018">2018</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmiller2000">Miller and Chamberlin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmiller2000">2000</a>). This
evident bias against women can be the root for lower ratings received by female input and
service providers. A recent study by <a 
href="#XWu2020">Wu</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XWu2020">2020</a>) found that there is a gender bias in
how women are perceived in professional circumstances, i.e., perceptions about women
mostly are less about their professional success and more about their physical or family
factors. This can be a major driving factor for why women are always rated lower than
men.
<!--l. 740--><p class="noindent" >In the context of this study, bias against women can aid the explanation for the minimal
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
involvement of women in agro-input dealing, trading and processing of maize. When women are
aware that they are perceived to be less capable for these business activities, they might not enter
the sector in the first place to avoid criticisms and performance obstacles at a later stage. Social
stringency and family practices might limit the women from performing better or being equally
competitive as the men. Another compelling reason for the lower ratings received by women
could be that their actual performance levels are worse than the men. Lower access to
facilities, finance and business guidance can be the drivers of worse performance for the
female dealers, traders and processors alongside the underlying societal aspects. These
arguments can be supported by the claims of <a 
href="#Xniethammer2013">Niethammer</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xniethammer2013">2013</a>), mentioning the significant
gender differences in the access to finance for the development of businesses and the lower
formal bank account penetration for women when compared to men in the developing
nations.
<!--l. 757--><p class="noindent" >A study done on the women entrepreneurs in the Kigali region of Rwanda by <a 
href="#XNsengimana2017">Nsengimana
et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XNsengimana2017">2017</a>) reported many challenges for the success of their businesses like the lack of collateral,
lack of information technology access, high interest rates for loans, lack of skill development
opportunities, cultural imperatives and psychological factors induced by the families and the
society. Similarly, <a 
href="#XGuma2015">Guma</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#XGuma2015">2015</a>) discusses the barriers faced by women entrepreneurs in Uganda.
Some of the prominent issues faced by women are gender-related stereotypes (risk-taking
behavior, higher levels of empathy and lower aggressiveness), under-capitalization (credit
access limits, availability of collateral), balance across multiple responsibilities (childcare,
family responsibilities, inter-role conflict), inadequate skills and business knowledge,
disapproval from societal standards, lack of respect from the male-dominated business
community, lack of support, time investment constraints, reputation and work credibility
challenges. These can significantly impact the ratings received by the female input and service
providers in the supply chain and can undermine their perceived performance in the
sector.
<!--l. 777--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the primary goal of hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70095">5<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 5 --></a> is to study the interaction between the sex of the rater
(farmer) and the ratee in order to investigate if there is some significant impact of both being of the
same sex on the ratings. This is mainly motivated by the literature studying homophily in social
networks. The homophily principle essentially focuses on network ties based on relationships and
characteristics of the actors involved. <a 
href="#Xmcpherson2001birds">McPherson et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xmcpherson2001birds">2001</a>) discussed the consequences
of such preferences like limitations in the social world, biased information, attitudes
influenced by the characteristics of the ties formed and interactions limited to these
homogeneous networks, arguing that gender based homophily can strongly divide personal
environments.
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
<!--l. 790--><p class="noindent" >Gender based homophily in food value chains can mean bias towards certain actors. For instance, if
a female farmer has higher preference for a female trader, she may always interact with traders of
the same sex. Other traders of opposite sex might be providing better services which this female
farmer will be deprived of. While rating if the farmers intentionally rate the input and service
providers of the same sex more or less favourably, incorrect performance perceptions will be
exposed within the value chain. This may impact the performance of these actors and make
business worse for some of the actors who received lower scores because of gender based homophily
in preferences.

<!--l. 818--><p class="noindent" >The data for this study come from a survey of 1,526 farming households, 78 agro-input dealer
shops, 341 assembly traders and 174 millers operating in the maize growing districts of
Iganga, Bugiri and Namutumba in Eastern Uganda. The data were collected in July
2019. The farmer household sample is drawn from 64 villages in the three districts.
Using the 2012 sampling frame of Uganda National Bureau of Statistics (UBoS), the
household sample per village was randomly allocated, proportionate to the village
population<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="MVC_perceptions_thesis2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-9001f1"></a> .
The villages were selected through a process of stratified random sampling at sub-county level. In
each of the three districts, the sub-counties from which the villages were sampled were purposely
selected based on their distance (km) from the main district town, in the range of 10 kms, 20 kms
and 30 kms from the main town. A map of the study area is given below (figure <a 
href="#x1-90021">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Map-of-the-study-area --></a>). The input
dealer shops, assembly traders and millers interviewed are those that were referred to by farmers,
either because they have ever purchased improved maize seed from them, sold harvest to traders or
processed (sold) maize at the milling farms or these supply chain actors are within their
vicinity.

<!--l. 845--><p class="noindent" >A key question that may arise is the degree to which results for the three study districts can be
generalized to Uganda as a whole. The representativeness of the study area is examined using maize
production figures. The Eastern region, where the three districts fall, accounted for the highest

remaining districts contributed less than 4%, including Bugiri (2.7%) which is part of this

Each farmer rates a minimum of one input dealer, trader or miller to a maximum of
three input dealers, traders or millers (ratees). Farmer perceptions about the ratees
and ratee perceptions about themselves are understood from the ratings given on four
dimensions of location, quality, price and reputation. The averages of these dimension
based ratings are obtained to get the overall average ratings (for both farmer ratings and
self-ratings).

the ratees in the lowest category on the location dimension (score of 1) while about 38
percent gave the highest rating for ease of reaching the ratee (score of 5). Gender of
the farmer is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if the farmer is a woman and 0
otherwise.
<!--l. 899--><p class="noindent" >Gender based rating patterns indicate that female farmers are more inclined to giving the highest
score of 5 for location (41 percent) compared to male farmers (36 percent). Considering the
dimensions, reputation and quality, larger shares of male farmers give a rating of 5 compared to the
female farmers. Higher percentage of male farmers think that ease of access is poor (at least level 2
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
score) and price competitiveness is poor (at least level 2 score) while higher percentage of female
farmers perceive poorer reputation of the ratees (at least level 2 score). Same percentage of
male and female farmers perceive poor quality of services from traders, millers or input
dealers.
<!--l. 911--><p class="noindent" >Education and marital status are dummies indicating whether the farmer has some level of
education and whether the farmer is married. It is interesting to note that 49 percent of the farmers
are women, most of them have some level of education (87 percent) and are married
(86 percent). The average age of the farmers is 44.5. The average distance of farmers&#8217;
homestead to tarmac road is 6.54 kms and to murram road is 0.51 km. Dummy variable for
interaction between farmers and the input dealer, trader or processor is also included. 88
percent of the farmers have had some business interaction with the individual they are
rating.

<!--l. 1018--><p class="noindent" >Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100032">2<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table2 --></a> shows summary statistics for the self-ratings from agro-input dealers, traders and maize
processors. The ratees (dealers, traders and millers) seem to be very confident about their
reputation as among all the dimensions, the highest percentage give a self-score of 5 for
reputation (58 percent). They seem to be the least confident about their location as
among all the dimensions, the highest percentage adhere to a score of at least 2 for
location.
<!--l. 1027--><p class="noindent" >Gender, education and marital status of these supply chain actors are dummy variables. Women
consist of 29 percent of the input dealers, only 2 percent of the traders and only 7 percent of the
millers. A very good share of these supply chain actors have some level of education and are
married. Although the average age of the dealers, traders and millers is between 35 and
40 years, there is noticeable variation in the oldest actor observed. The oldest input
dealer is 66 years old, the oldest trader is 80 years old while the oldest miller is 75 years
old.
<!--l. 1040--><p class="noindent" >Looking at self-ratings based on the sex of the ratee, it is noticed that among all the different
dimensions, the greatest percentage of female ratees rate themselves 5 for quality (68
percent) and the highest percentage of male ratees rate themselves 5 for reputation (59
percent). Giving self-scores of 5 is more common in women for location, price and quality.
However, male ratees think themselves to be more well reputed. Indeed, women think the
quality of their services or products are way better as they never rate themselves below 3
and men think they are well reputed as only 1 percent of them rate themselves below
3.
<!--l. 1053--><p class="noindent" >The primary variables of interest in this study are ratings (perceived attributes) from farmers
(raters), self-ratings (perceived self-attributes) from ratees, the sex of the farmer and
the ratee. In order to identify the ratees as input dealers, traders or processors, unique
identifiers were attached to them. Similarly, unique identifiers were also assigned to each
farmer.

<!--l. 1065--><p class="noindent" >Testing whether the ratings are actually meaningful (instead of just noise) is important.
This will give better insights about the validity of the perceptions. I look at intra-class
correlation (ICC) coefficients determining the level of agreement between the ratings. In
other words, ICC coefficients are a measure of inter or intra rater reliability. Inter or
intra rater reliability in the ratings literature means levels of agreement between the
ratings from different raters (<a 
href="#Xgwet2014handbook">Gwet</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgwet2014handbook">2014</a>). Inter rater reliability (agreement) looks at
how close the ratings from different farmers are for an individual ratee while intra rater
reliability (agreement) looks at how close the different ratings from an individual farmer
are.
<!--l. 1078--><p class="noindent" >Intra-class correlation coefficient can range between 0 and 1. The lower it is, the poorer is the
agreement and the higher it is, the better is the agreement level. In this context, inter and
intra-rater reliability is studied for all the ratings given by the raters (farmers). Only farmers who
rated more than 6 times are considered for this analysis (to reduce loss of observations
during the analysis). The ICC coefficients indicating inter-rater reliability compare the
ratings for each ratee from different farmers (raters). This helps to understand the level
of agreement among the farmers on the different attributes of a particular ratee. The
ICC coefficients indicating intra-rater reliability compare the various ratings given by
each individual farmer. This shows how similar or different the farmer rates the various
ratees.

<!--l. 1118--><p class="noindent" >Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-110013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table3 --></a> presents the ICC coefficients. Firstly, it can be inferred that raters (farmers) agree decently
on overall ratings given to ratees. The ICC coefficient being 0.54, it can be deduced that the
ratings captured in the survey are not entirely random or untrue. However, the level of
agreement among the raters (farmers) drop majorly for quality (0.15) and reputation (0.24).
For location and price based ratings, the agreement levels are higher (0.47, 0.43). This
is expected as location and prices are observable factors and hence, ratings for these
factors should be more similar compared to non-observable attributes like quality and
reputation.
<!--l. 1133--><p class="noindent" >Secondly, analysing the overall averaged rating pattern, it can be derived that every farmer rates in
a similar way every dealer, trader or miller. This is because the ICC coefficient is 0.64 (table&#x00A0;<a

indicating a very decent level of agreement. Similar high levels of agreements are noticed for
location (0.62) and reputation (0.68) based ratings.

<!--l. 1240--><p class="noindent" >An essential discussion is the motivation behind the inclusion of the control variables discussed in
the models above. Men are likely to be better educated than women. Better levels of education and
knowledge will probably mean that farmers have a better understanding of what to expect from
service and input providers, and so, may rate more or less favourably (the ratings or scores
given will be better informed). One does have to control for this impact pathway as
otherwise, the gender and education effects will be conflated. In other words, correlation
between the farmer&#8217;s gender and the rating from the farmer may be confounded by
education. Women are likely to be younger than men because of recent entry into farming
activities and also, older women devote more time to family responsibilities. Thus, age
may directly affect ratings. For instance, older individuals may have more experience
and so, may rate more or less critically. Therefore, age effects need to be purged from
the model by controlling for it. Similar to age, mobility may directly affect ratings. In
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
particular, men are more mobile and so more likely to have interacted with input dealers. If
these interactions lead to systematically different ratings, it is necessary to control for
it.
<!--l. 1260--><p class="noindent" >Distance to murram and tarmac roads are proxies of remoteness. In remote areas, input and service
providers face many challenges such as larger transaction costs and poor access to services such as
power. For instance, in semi-urban areas, mills often run on 3-phase electricity, while in remote
areas, combustion engines are used to power the mills. The latter produce inferior quality maize
products. These differences will be reflected in the ratings because farmers in remote areas tend to
reach out to the input and service providers operating in those same areas. Thus, by controlling for
distance of farmer&#8217;s homestead to murram and tarmac roads, these differences are accounted
for.
<!--l. 1271--><p class="noindent" >Men in farming activities tend to be married. On the other hand, it can be expected that women in
farming are mostly not married as married women get involved more in household activities. Being
married could mean that these farmers have been longer in maize production and thus,
have more experience with service and input providers. This might make their ratings
more or less favourable which makes it important to control for marital status of the
farmer.
<!--l. 1279--><p class="noindent" >The arguments can be similar in the case of ratees. Since men are likely to be more
educated than women, the education and knowledge might define what kind of service
and inputs they provide to their customers (better or worse knowledge of improved
services or inputs). This would lead to more or less favourable ratings from farmers
and self-ratings, justifying the need to control for education of ratees. Men are likely to
be older because of longer active periods in service providing and input dealing. Older
individuals might have better experience in the business. This can impact the ratings.
Farmers may rate older ratees with more experience more favourably while self-ratings are
likely to be higher from older individuals because of their greater awareness about their
performance in the sector. Hence, I control for age of the ratee (input dealer, trader or
miller).
<!--l. 1293--><p class="noindent" >Controlling for marital status of ratees is necessary as married service and input providers mostly
tend to be men. This would mean they would have better knowledge and experience (more time
spent in business as the chances of being married increases with age) which might lead to more
favourable ratings from farmers. At the same time, women who are not married might be rating
themselves lower because of minimal experience, knowledge, connections and support in their
businesses. Therefore, purging marital status effects of the ratees from the model is

<!--l. 1605--><p class="noindent" >Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a> shows that the mean overall self-rating given by the ratees (4.22) is higher than the mean
rating from the farmers (3.6). This phenomenon is consistent across all the different rating
dimensions. Looking at individual groups of input dealers, traders and millers in table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a>, the same
inference can be made that self-ratings are always higher. These findings support hypothesis
<a 
href="#x1-70011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 1 --></a>.
<!--l. 1614--><p class="noindent" >In order to validate hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70032">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 2 --></a> from the trends in the dataset, I will first look at the entire group
of ratees. The mean overall rating from female farmers is 3.62 which is higher than the mean overall
rating given by male farmers (3.58). Similar pattern is noticed for location, price and
reputation based ratings. However, for quality based rating, male farmers give a higher
rating. Interestingly, these patterns vary across the groups of input dealers, traders and
millers. For overall average ratings, location and price based ratings, female farmers
always give better scores to dealers, traders and processors. Male farmers give better
scores for quality to dealers while lower scores for quality to traders and millers when
compared to their female counterparts. More favourable scores for reputation of dealers
and millers come from men while for traders, come from women. Thus, hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70032">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 2 --></a>
is generally true with an exception for quality and reputation based ratings from the
farmers.
<!--l. 1633--><p class="noindent" >Next, I focus on the comparison of self-ratings from women and men. For overall average
self-rating, women (4.16) rate lower compared to men (4.23). This is consistent for location and
reputation based self-ratings. However, for quality and price, men self-assess themselves worse than
how women self-assess themselves. These findings are similar for each rating dimension in the case
of input dealers. Self-ratings from male assembly traders are always lower than female
assembly traders except when they are rating for reputation. The results obtained from the
mean self-ratings of the entire ratee group reflect in the results for the miller group in
particular. However, the only exception is the overall average self-rating where male
millers assess themselves worse than the female millers. Thus, supporting hypothesis
<a 
href="#x1-70053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 3 --></a>, it can be stated that although women tend to generally self-assess less favourably;
for quality and price, women tend to self-assess more favourably when compared to
men.
<!--l. 1650--><p class="noindent" >Following this, the focus is on the sex of the ratees and the ratings from the farmers. Men receive
less favourable ratings for overall average, quality and reputation. For location and price, women
receive better scores than men. These findings are consistent for the group of agro-input dealers
across the rating dimensions. However, both male and female input dealers receive the
same overall average rating. Interestingly, all male assembly traders receive lower scores
across all the rating dimensions than the female assembly traders. Thus, female assembly
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
traders are perceived to be performing better. In the case of millers, women always
receive less favourable ratings, with an exception for quality. Thus, hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 4 --></a> does
not entirely align with these findings from table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a>. Women mostly are rated lower for
location and price whereas men are rated worse overall and for quality and reputation
mostly.
<!--l. 1665--><p class="noindent" >Next, I examine how men rate other men and women rate other women. The average ratings show
that women give more favourable ratings to other women compared to men&#8217;s ratings for other men,
only in the case of overall average, quality and reputation. All female traders are always rated
higher by female farmers in every dimension of rating. Male millers are generally rated higher by
male farmers with an exception for quality. Women rate female agro-input dealers higher for all
aspects except for quality. These findings portray the underlying idea of hypothesis
<a 
href="#x1-70095">5<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 5 --></a>.
<!--l. 1675--><p class="noindent" >It is interesting to note that generally, women are always rated higher for quality (consistent for
dealers, traders and processors), indicating provision of better quality from women. Similarly, men
are consistently rated higher for location with an exception for traders. This may indicate that
women (dealers and millers) are located in poorer locations. Some of the reasons behind that could
be mobility constraints, lack of capital to set up businesses in better locations and less knowledge of
good locations for business.
<!--l. 1684--><p class="noindent" >Farmer ratings indicate that price competitiveness of male input dealers and millers are perceived
to be better, women in input dealing and trading and men in processing of maize are perceived to
be well-reputed. The rating attribute that is always scored the lowest is price competitiveness and
that is always scored the highest is ease of access for traders and reputation for agro-input dealers
and millers. Input dealers get the lowest score for ease of access and price competitiveness and
millers get the lowest rating for overall average, quality and reputation. Thus, agro-input
dealers are overall not easy to reach while assembly traders are. In terms of the quality of
service provided, input dealers are perceived to be the best in comparison to traders and
millers.

<!--l. 1700--><p class="noindent" >Tables&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150015">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table5 --></a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150026">6<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table6 --></a> and&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150037">7<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table7 --></a> present results from the regressions implemented for this study. Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150015">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table5 --></a> shows
multivariate regressions with clustered standard errors (at the ratee level), discussing the impact of
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
the sex of the farmer (rater) and the ratee on the ratings given by the farmers to the ratees. From
model 1, it is noticeable that the impact of the sex of the farmer on the average overall rating given
by the farmer is significant. If the farmer is a woman, the average score given by the farmer is
0.06 higher. Thus, female farmers give more favourable ratings when compared to male
farmers, consistent with the results from table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a>. The relation between the gender of the
ratee (dealer, trader or miller) and the overall average ratings given by the farmer is
insignificant.
<!--l. 1715--><p class="noindent" >If the farmer had some business interaction with the input dealer, trader or processor
the farmer is rating, the rating given by the farmer is approximately 0.4 point higher
(significant). The education level of the farmer significantly influences the way the farmer rates
the ratee. If the farmer has some level of education, the farmer (rater) rates the ratee
0.09 point higher. The negative relation between the average overall rating given by
the farmer and the distance of the farmer&#8217;s homestead from the nearest murram road
is also significant. This means greater distance from the murram road would imply a
lower score given by the farmer (rater). There is a negative relationship between the
ratee&#8217;s marital status and the ratings received by the ratee. If the ratee is married, the
ratee receives a significantly lower score. Ratings for dealers are higher on average by
approximately 0.09 point (significant) and ratings for traders are significantly higher on average
by 0.19 point (consistent with table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a> results). The total number of observations is
3589.
<!--l. 1735--><p class="noindent" >The interaction between the sex of the farmer and the sex of the ratee is insignificant throughout
all the models in table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150015">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table5 --></a>. In other words, no significant gender based homophily effect is found
(disproving hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70095">5<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 5 --></a>). The positive relationship between sex of the farmer and the farmer&#8217;s
ratings is significantly consistent for location-based and price-based ratings (models 3, 4, 7 and 8).
This is consistent with the results from table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a>. However, the magnitude of more favourable ratings
from female farmers is most noticeable for location-based ratings, being highly significant too.
Interestingly, for quality and reputation based ratings, if the ratee is a woman, the farmer&#8217;s rating
increases significantly. However, the ratings decline for location based ratings if the ratee is a
woman (similar findings in table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a>). Thus, it can be inferred that female farmers give more
favourable scores overall (proving hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70032">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 2 --></a>), particularly for location and price and female
ratees receive better scores from farmers only for quality and reputation (disproving hypothesis
<a 
href="#x1-70074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 4 --></a>).

<!--l. 1967--><p class="noindent" >Following this, table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150026">6<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table6 --></a> shows the results from multiple regression analysis looking at the impact of
sex of the ratee on self-assessments (self-ratings). The relationship is significant only for
quality, price and reputaion based self-ratings. If the ratee is a woman, she significantly
self-assesses herself higher than the male ratees for quality and price. However, for reputation,
she rates herself lower (significant). These results are consistent with the findings from
table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a>. Looking at model 1, it can be noted that older and educated ratees self-assess
themselves higher significantly and married ratees self-assess themselves lower significantly.
Consistent with table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140024">4<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table4 --></a> results, it can be observed that traders significantly give higher
self-ratings while dealers give significantly lower self-ratings. Henceforth, it can be inferred
that for quality and price, women self-assess themselves higher while for reputation,
lower. Here, hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 3 --></a> is only consistent with the finding about reputation based
self-ratings.

<!--l. 2060--><p class="noindent" >Finally, table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150037">7<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table7 --></a> studies the relationship between farmer&#8217;s and ratee&#8217;s gender and the differences
between the farmer ratings and ratee self-ratings. Here, again the standard errors are clustered at
the ratee level. The differences increase significantly for the overall average ratings, location and
price based ratings if the farmer is a woman (also for reputation (model 10), when the interaction
term is added). This means female farmers give significantly more different ratings compared to the
self-assessments by the ratees themselves. The impact of the sex of the ratee on the
differences is interesting as the differences in ratings decline significantly for quality and price
if the ratee is a woman while the differences increase in the case of reputation based
ratings.
<!--l. 2073--><p class="noindent" >The interaction between sex of the farmer and the ratee (gender based homophily) is insignificant.
If the farmer had some business interaction with the ratee or if the farmer has some level of
education, the differences rise significantly. If the farmer is married, the differences in ratings
decline. In the case of dealers and traders being rated, the differences increase significantly.
Therefore, it can be stated that women give more different ratings than self-assessments,
particularly in the case of location and price. The gender of the ratee only matters significantly
when differences in ratings based on quality, price and reputation are considered. From these
inferences, it can be derived that indeed self-assessments can be different from the actual ratings
received from the farmers (aligns with the idea of hypothesis <a 
href="#x1-70011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: Hypothesis 1 --></a>) and gender influences these
differences. Investigating the intercepts in table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-150037">7<!--tex4ht:ref: table:table7 --></a>, it can be noted that the coefficients are
significantly negative for overall average rating differences, quality, price and reputation based
rating differences. This indicates that self-ratings are always higher than the farmers&#8217; ratings
(in the case of quality, price and reputation), a strong evidence supporting hypothesis

<!--l. 2310--><p class="noindent" >The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions of maize farmers about the
input and service providers in the maize value chain and the perceptions of these input
and service providers about themselves. Focusing on gender, I tested if gender-based
heterogeneity can be observed in perceptions. The perceptions were captured through the ratings
given on dimensions like ease of access, quality of service, price competitiveness and
reputation.
<!--l. 2318--><p class="noindent" >The main findings suggest that women give more favourable scores. They have significant positive
perceptions, particularly across the dimensions of location and price competitiveness.
This tendency of women to rate more favourably can have some repercussions. The
input and service providers can take advantage of the leniency of female farmers and
provide them with lower quality inputs and services. Also, the prices may not be too
favourable for these female farmers. In this context, policy interventions are needed
to ensure that all farmers are aware of the standard prices and the quality of inputs
and services they deserve. However, sex of the individual being rated does not matter
significantly.
<!--l. 2330--><p class="noindent" >Self-assessments are always significantly more positive than the ratings from the farmers across
most of the dimensions (overall, quality, price competitiveness and reputation). In other words,
input dealers, traders and processors have more positive perceptions about themselves compared to
the perceptions (ratings) of the farmers. In particular, women&#8217;s ratings are noticeably different from
the self-assessments obtained. This indicates a gap between the farmers and the input and service
providers. The interactions between these actors need to be structured in a way where
perceived performance information can be conveyed easily, creating the opportunity for
improvements.
<!--l. 2341--><p class="noindent" >This study shows that while self-assessing, the gender of the individual does not matter for the
overall ratings. However, women give significantly less favourable self-assessments for reputation
and more favourable for quality and price competitiveness. This is a very important finding about
how women already perceive that they do not have good reputation among the farmers even if they
provide favourable prices and good quality. These perceptions can be very close to the reality of
the mechanisms in these supply chains. Women in business may be less favourable due
to gender bias and traditional societal thoughts where women are expected to have
less potential and capabilities to do well in businesses. Henceforth, provision of policies
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
are necessary for greater opportunities, training facilities, spread of awareness, credit
availabilities and support for women. However, homophily in gender was not evident in this
study.
<!--l. 2356--><p class="noindent" >From the average ratings, it can be inferred that traders receive the highest ratings, followed by
input dealers. Millers obtain the lowest scores. In particular, millers&#8217; quality of services and
reputation suffer from lowest ratings. More focus is thus needed on the processors of maize in
Uganda. Female agro-input dealers, traders and millers always are perceived to be performing
better in terms of quality. This is consistent with the self-perceptions of women. Thus, may be
women are more prone to caring about the quality of services and inputs compared to the men.
Interestingly, male dealers and millers are perceived to be easily accessible and have
better prices. Male millers and female input dealers and traders obtain good scores for
reputation.
<!--l. 2368--><p class="noindent" >Surprisingly, price competitiveness is always scored the lowest. Thus, standardized prices are
needed in the sector. Highly volatile prices threaten price protection for the farmers and can create
mistrust among the farmers and the input and service providers. Among all the input and
service providers, traders are the most easily reachable actors and dealers and millers are
the best reputed ones. Input dealers are perceived to be performing worst in the case
of location and price competitiveness. Hence, it is essential to ensure that agro-input
dealers are easily reachable to encourage higher usage of improved seed. This can be one
of the reasons explaining why lower usage of improved seed has consistently been a
matter of concern. Subsidies for the sale prices of inputs and transportation aid from the
government can improve the sale prices and ease of access to these dealers. However, ratings
for quality are the highest in the case of dealers (indicating provision of good quality
seeds).
<!--l. 2384--><p class="noindent" >These perceptions are very important in the maize supply chain and give a lot of insight about the
perceived performance levels of the input and service providers. Gender-based perceptions
prominently indicate gendered preferences in the supply chain which is essential to be addressed.
More women with greater support and business knowledge are needed in this sector to
tackle the imbalance of preferences revealed in the perceptions (ratings) analysed in this
study. Since the share of female millers and traders is very small in this study, more
balanced samples of the supply chain actors could reveal better and highly significant
results.
<!--l. 2395--><p class="noindent" >Future research should focus on perceptions of the input and service providers about the farmers,
investigating similar trends in ratings and the change in perceptions over time captured through
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
future surveys. A compelling addition to the literature can be the relationship between competition
in this sector and the perceived performances of the actors. Investigating perceptions in the maize
demand chain and then linking those perceptions with the perceived performances of the supply
chain actors can reveal interesting results. Thus, the maize value chain holds a lot of
opportunities for future research in different directions using perceptions of the value chain
actors.
