  abstract = {{To reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa requires raising productivity in agriculture. Systematic use of fertilizer and hybrid seed is a pathway to increased productivity, but adoption of these technologies remains low. We investigate whether the quality of agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up. Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that 30\\% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50\\% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are noisy, farmers’ ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not fully collapsed. }},

  abstract = {Rapid urban growth is straining infrastructures, economies, and food security of cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Amid competing issues of sanitation, housing, and unemployment, planning for urban food security receives less attention. Despite the proliferation of supermarkets in SSA, informal food vendors remain crucial sources of food for the majority of households. However, as cities grow and planners try to adapt, these informal vendors are generally left out of planning considerations, marginalized by policies that do not support this business model, or subjected to political vicissitudes. This paper analyzes how vendors in emerging cities are economically, socially, and spatially integrated within the urban food system, highlighting the assets these vendors represent and the ways they might support growth in cities. We map vendors’ networks of food suppliers, and describe sources of operating capital and labor assets to show the range of services vendors utilize and the types of institutions, businesses, and individuals that vendors use to support their work. We spatially analyze the relationship between vendors and suppliers, and between vendors and households, to demonstrate how enmeshed these vendors are in the broader food system and the links they create between consumers and suppliers. We demonstrate that due to spatial differences and vendors’ and consumers’ needs in emerging cities, a one-size-fits-all approach for integration of informal vendors in the food system is less likely to be successful in terms of either economic development or household food security.},

Drawing on the Big Middle theory of retail evolution, an analysis of secondary and primary survey data on Thai shopping behavior seeks to understand the shift away from wet markets to supermarkets. On all salient attributes affecting retail outlet choice, supermarkets outperform wet markets. While wet markets continue to account for the majority of expenditure on fresh produce their market share has eroded sharply. A bootstrapped bivariate ordered probit model identifies the characteristics of supermarket and wet market shoppers. The analysis questions previous work which perceived wet markets in East Asia as possessing a long-term competitive advantage in food retailing.},

  abstract = {Organizations implement formalized procedures to eliminate the biasing effects of gender and other characteristics on evaluations. Prior work shows managers play a key role, but researchers have been unable to observe the thought processes guiding managers’ evaluations. This article takes a first step in examining managers’ sensemaking as they interpret and evaluate employee behaviors. Our data include managers’ written performance reviews and numeric ratings of employees at a Fortune 500 technology company. Our theoretical model—the Viewing and Valuing Social Cognitive Processing Model—explains how and when gender beliefs frame managers’ evaluations, affecting what behaviors managers notice (i.e., view) and rate highly (i.e., value). After conducting a detailed coding of the language in reviews, we assess whether there are gender differences in (1) the language used to describe performance (i.e., viewing differences) and (2) the correlations between that language and numeric ratings (i.e., valuing differences). Our analysis of 88 language attributes reveals where gender frames managers’ evaluations and where the process instead operates gender-neutrally. For example, men and women are equally likely to be described as having technical ability, while women are viewed as too aggressive and men as too soft. Furthermore, some behaviors, such as “taking charge,” are more valued for men than for women: “taking charge” is associated with the highest performance ratings for men but not for women. Overall, our analysis identifies novel ways that gender biases emerge in a process intended to be meritocratic.},

Using data on more than 9,000 submissions from the Annual Congress of the European Economic Association (2015–17), the Annual Meeting of the Spanish Economic Association (2012–17) and the Spring Meeting of Young Economists (2018), we find that all-female-authored papers are 3.3\% points (p.p.), or 6.8\%, less likely to be accepted than all-male-authored papers. The estimated gap ranges from 5.4 p.p. (95\% CI: 2.5 p.p., 8.3 p.p.) to 2.9 p.p. (0 p.p., 5.8 p.p.). This gap is present after controlling for number of authors of the paper; field; referee fixed effects; cites of the paper; authors’ previous publication record, affiliations, and experience; and connections between the authors of a given paper and the referees that evaluate it. We provide evidence suggesting that the gap is driven by stereotypes against female authors: it is entirely driven by male referees, only exists for lesser-known authors, and seems larger in more masculine fields, especially in finance.},

  abstract = {Improving agricultural output and food security is a major concern in sub-Saharan Africa, but many efforts to help farmers improve yields have failed. Recent research has shown that farm inputs are often of very low quality, which may explain suboptimal yields and low adoption of inputs. Researchers and policy makers have focused on two main explanations for this low quality: sellers purposefully faking or adulterating inputs, and seed deterioration along the supply chain. We present the results of testing seeds along the maize supply chain in Uganda for seed performance and genetic and physical purity. We obtain two main results. First, we find no evidence that the average quality of seeds deteriorates along the supply chain. In fact, we find generally good levels of quality on average, though variation in outcomes increases further down the supply chain. Second, we do not find evidence of serious seed faking or adulteration. Instead, the results are more consistent with mishandling and poor storage of seeds. These results have potentially significant implications for agricultural policy and programming in sub-Saharan Africa, which has tended recently to focus on certification to reduce the possibility of adulteration rather than improve the handling of inputs.},

Based on expectation states theory (EST) as well as Social Role Theory (SRT), we aim to understand whether the perception of the quality of financial advice is affected by gender bias; that is, do people trust the ability of male financial advisors to earn profits more than female financial advisors’ ability to do so? To analyze our assessments, we interviewed female financial advisors and conducted two quantitative studies. The first quantitative study, in which 1,600 respondents participated, examined whether the financial advisor's gender impacts how subjects appraise the probability of success versus the level of loss. This was followed by a second study designed to examine the presence of hidden gender bias by applying a conjoint analysis model. The results, as reflected from the interviews, indicated that female financial advisors do not feel discriminated against by clients on the basis of gender. This finding is consistent with the results of the first quantitative study, which showed gender bias was latent and revealed only in particular cases, such as in the case of a high investment amount. However, the conjoint analysis results, which explored more hidden preferences, indicated that the advisor's gender is one of the most important factors influencing a consumer's decision when choosing an investment advisor. Hence, female advisors’ gender was found to have a negative effect on the desire to invest, and this negative attitude was found to be significantly higher among male respondents. Thus, the first study's result showed that when asked directly, participants are indifferent as to the financial advisor's gender, however, ideally people prefer male advisor over female, as shown in the second study. A summary of the findings shows that a perceptual change is still needed in order to reduce negative perceptions towards female advisors.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite a 2010 Kenyan constitutional amendment limiting members of elected public bodies to < two-thirds of the same gender, only 22 percent of the 12th Parliament members inaugurated in 2017 were women. Investigating gender bias in the media is a useful tool for understanding socio-cultural barriers to implementing legislation for gender equality. Natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as word embedding and sentiment analysis, can efficiently quantify media biases at a scope previously unavailable in the social sciences.Methods: We trained GloVe and word2vec word embeddings on text from 1998 to 2019 from Kenya’s Daily Nation newspaper. We measured gender bias in these embeddings and used sentiment analysis to predict quantitative sentiment scores for sentences surrounding female leader names compared to male leader names.Results: Bias in leadership words for men and women measured from Daily Nation word embeddings corresponded to temporal trends in men and women’s participation in political leadership (i.e., parliamentary seats) using GloVe (correlation 0.8936, p = 0.0067, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.799) and word2vec (correlation 0.844, p = 0.0169, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.712) algorithms. Women continue to be associated with domestic terms while men continue to be associated with influence terms, for both regular gender words and female and male political leaders’ names. Male words (e.g., he, him, man) were mentioned 1.84 million more times than female words from 1998 to 2019. Sentiment analysis showed an increase in relative negative sentiment associated with female leaders (p = 0.0152) and an increase in positive sentiment associated with male leaders over time (p = 0.0216).Conclusion: Natural language processing is a powerful method for gaining insights into and quantifying trends in gender biases and sentiment in news media. We found evidence of improvement in gender equality but also a backlash from increased female representation in high-level governmental leadership.},

  abstract = {Abstract Motivation Faced by imperfect information about the performance of value chain actors, transactions are often based on perceptions. Inaccurate perceptions may result in inefficient value chains. Biased perceptions, especially about women, may affect inclusiveness. Purpose We aim to compare perceptions by farmers, input dealers, traders and processors in Uganda’s maize value chain. Specifically, we compare ratings given by farmers to self-ratings of dealers, traders and processors. We test if male farmers rate others differently than female farmers do; if men and women rate themselves differently; and whether female farmers rate female value chain actors higher being of the same gender (homophily). Methods and approach A random sample of 1,526 small-scale farmers growing maize from Eastern Uganda were asked to rate agro-input dealers, traders and processors by ease of access, quality of services, price competitiveness, and reputation. These value chain actors — 78 agro-input dealers, 341 assembly traders and 174 processors — were then asked to assess themselves. Descriptive analysis, t-tests and multivariate regression with two-way non-nested clustering were used for the analysis. Findings We find that input dealers, traders and processors rate themselves higher than farmers rate them. For self-assessments, the gender of the value chain actor does not matter. Female farmers tend to rate the dealers, traders and processors more highly than male farmers do. The sex of the actor rated does not affect the rating they receive: we also find no signs that women rate women more highly than they rate men. Policy implications It is reassuring to see that in Eastern Uganda, women as dealers, traders and processors were not rated lower than their male counterparts. It was equally reassuring to see that dealers, traders and processors were rated well for quality by farmers — a frequent concern in Uganda is that they provide poor services. They did not score so well, however, for competitive prices. Policies to encourage competition and new entrants may help. That dealers, traders and processors rate themselves more highly than farmers do, could lead to complacency, hindering investment and innovation. The gap in perceptions might be reduced if there were certification by an independent agency, or if farmer ratings were crowd-sourced.},

  abstract  = {If household income is pooled and then allocated to maximize welfare then income under the control of mothers and fathers should have the same impact on demand. With survey data on family health and nutrition in Brazil, the equality of parental income effects is rejected. Unearned income in the hands of a mother has a bigger effect on her family's health than income under the control of a father; for child survival probabilities the effect is almost twenty times bigger. The common preference (or neoclassical) model of the household is rejected. If unearned income is measured with error and income is pooled then the ratio of maternal to paternal income effects should be the same; equality of the ratios cannot be rejected. There is also evidence for gender preference: mothers prefer to devote resources to improving the nutritional status of their daughters, fathers to sons.},
