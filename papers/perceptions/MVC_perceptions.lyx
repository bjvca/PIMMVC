\begin_layout Title
Input dealer attributes and the use of improved maize seed in Uganda: Farmers’
 and Input Dealers’ Perceptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the past decade, and for the next National Development Plan (NDP) 2020/21-2
024/25, the Government of Uganda has prioritized the maize for national
 food security and increased household incomes.
 This is based on the crop’s impressive past performance and contribution
 to the country’s foreign exchange earnings despite its increasing vulnerability
 to climate risks and unpredictable output and price fluctuations.
 The maize sub-sector is among the three crop sectors (in addition to cassava
 and bananas) that contributed to the recovery of the agricultural sector
 in the FY 2017/18 and 2018/19.
 Maize exports increased from USD 105.7 million in FY 2014/15 to USD 148.7
 million in FY 2017/18 but reduced to USD 66.4 million in FY 2018/19.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government’s interventions in the maize sub-sector have targeted increasing
 on-farm productivity and production, yet productivity remains low.
 Research station trials in Uganda have demonstrated that yields range between
 730 kg per acre and 1,820 kg per acre 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Yet, on-farm estimates are generally lower.
 A recent study of on-farm yield reports figures between 270 kg per acre
 and 995 kg per acre 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Limited use of improved inputs (especially climate resilient seed varieties)
 is one among many contributing factors to low maize/agricultural yields
 in Uganda.
 Explanations for the limited use of improved inputs have mainly centered
 on the characteristics of the farmer/household (e.g income, gender, education
 level, location), market characteristics and characteristics of the inputs
 (e.g yield level, labour requirements, etc).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, concerns about seed quality have come to the center of the debate
 in both policy circles and among researchers.
 In a recent study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 document that purchased inputs appear of low quality.
 For instance, hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50% authentic
 seeds.
 At the same time, in Tanzania and for the case of fertilizer, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 find that it is not so much the quality of the input, but rather how it
 is perceived.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 find that in Uganda, herbicides also suffer from sub-standard quality and
 perceptions of farmers are fairly accurate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we investigate how perceptions on a range of seed dealer
 attributes align between farmers, and between farmers and seed dealers.
 The five attributes studied, as rated (on a scale of 1-5) by sample farmers
 and input dealers themselves in Eastern Uganda, are: (i) location (ease
 of access) of the input dealer relative to other dealers; (ii) price of
 seed charged by a given dealer relative to other dealers; (iii) quality
 of seed sold by a given dealer relative to the other dealers; (iv) level
 of honesty relative to other dealers; and (v) reputation of a given dealer
 relative to other dealers.
 First, a sample of 1,526 maize farmers were asked to rate up to three input
 dealers they have ever purchased improved seed from or those in their vicinity.
 Similar questions were asked to input dealers to rate fellow input dealers
 in their vicinity.

\begin_layout Section
Study objectives 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the five attributes and their respective ratings, statistical and
 econometric tests for ranked data will be applied to determine the variations
 or agreements in: relative rating of the all attributes; rating of same
 attribute by different farmers (e.g between rural-based farmers and close-to-tow
n farmers ); and rating between farmers and input dealers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal is to establish the key attribute(s) that influence farmer-input
 dealer relationships and hence demand/use of improved maize seed.
 The findings will be useful in guiding the current discourse in Uganda
 on the strategies to strengthen trust and links between farmers and input
 dealers especially under the e-voucher input system being piloted by government.

\begin_layout Section
Research Questions & Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is there variation in how farmers rate input providers on the five characteristi
cs (H0= there is no variation in the farmers’ ratings)? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is there more agreement on one characteristic (eg.
 price) than on another (eg.
 reputation) by different farmers e.g between rural-based and close-to-town
 farmers? (H0= there is more agreement on any given characteristic).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is there agreement between ratings that farmers give to input providers
 and the ratings that input providers give to themselves? (H0= there is
 agreement between the ratings of farmers and input dealers themselves).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimate intra-class correlation (ICC) with classes formed by farmers and
 input provider.
 ICC is widely used to measure the extent of agreement and consistency among
 raters for two or more numerical or quantitative variables

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimate correlation between different characteristics (controlling for
 additional variables)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Estimate correlation (and plot differences) between ratings agro-input dealers
 give to themselves and averages of farmer scores per input dealer.
