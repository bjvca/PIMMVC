	abstract = { Improved maize seed is instrumental to deliver an Asian-style {\lq}green revolution{\rq} for Africa. The paper reviews and makes a comparative analysis of the maize (corn) seed sector and its evolution in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia drawing from seed sector surveys and secondary data. Enhancing farmers{\rq} access to and use of new maize varieties still presents a number of challenges in eastern Africa -- not least due to a number of policy and institutional impediments to the development of the seed sector. The regional seed sectors also show some remarkable contrasts: they have evolved at different speeds and in different directions, driven by diverging agricultural growth opportunities and varying degrees of regulation, liberalization and restructuring. The paper reiterates calls for an enabling environment for private seed companies to evolve in order to serve the diverse farmer communities so that they benefit from existing and future improved maize seed opportunities. },

	abstract = {Based on a two-round household panel survey conducted in Eastern Uganda, this study shows that the analysis of the inverse scale-productivity relationship (IR) is highly sensitive to how plot-level maize production is measured. While farmer-reported production-based plot-level maize yield regressions consistently lend support to the IR, the comparable regressions estimated with maize yields based on sub-plot crop cutting, full-plot crop cutting, and remote sensing point towards constant returns to scale, at the mean as well as throughout the distributions. In deriving the much-debated coefficient for GPS-based plot area, the maize yield regressions control for objective measures of soil fertility and edge effects at the plot-level, as well as time-invariant household- and parcel-level unobserved heterogeneity in select specifications. The core finding appears to be driven by over-estimation of farmer-reported maize production vis-{\`a}-vis their crop cutting-based counterparts, particularly in the lower half of the plot area distribution.},

	abstract = {{To reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa requires raising productivity in agriculture. Systematic use of fertilizer and hybrid seed is a pathway to increased productivity, but adoption of these technologies remains low. We investigate whether the quality of agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up. Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that 30\\% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50\\% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are noisy, farmers{\rq} ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not fully collapsed. }},
