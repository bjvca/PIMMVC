  abstract = {Improved maize seed is instrumental to deliver an Asian-style {\lq}green revolution{\rq} for Africa. The paper reviews and makes a comparative analysis of the maize (corn) seed sector and its evolution in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia drawing from seed sector surveys and secondary data. Enhancing farmers{\rq} access to and use of new maize varieties still presents a number of challenges in eastern Africa -- not least due to a number of policy and institutional impediments to the development of the seed sector. The regional seed sectors also show some remarkable contrasts: they have evolved at different speeds and in different directions, driven by diverging agricultural growth opportunities and varying degrees of regulation, liberalization and restructuring. The paper reiterates calls for an enabling environment for private seed companies to evolve in order to serve the diverse farmer communities so that they benefit from existing and future improved maize seed opportunities.},

  abstract = {Based on a two-round household panel survey conducted in Eastern Uganda, this study shows that the analysis of the inverse scale-productivity relationship (IR) is highly sensitive to how plot-level maize production is measured. While farmer-reported production-based plot-level maize yield regressions consistently lend support to the IR, the comparable regressions estimated with maize yields based on sub-plot crop cutting, full-plot crop cutting, and remote sensing point towards constant returns to scale, at the mean as well as throughout the distributions. In deriving the much-debated coefficient for GPS-based plot area, the maize yield regressions control for objective measures of soil fertility and edge effects at the plot-level, as well as time-invariant household- and parcel-level unobserved heterogeneity in select specifications. The core finding appears to be driven by over-estimation of farmer-reported maize production vis-{\`a}-vis their crop cutting-based counterparts, particularly in the lower half of the plot area distribution.},

  abstract = {{To reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa requires raising productivity in agriculture. Systematic use of fertilizer and hybrid seed is a pathway to increased productivity, but adoption of these technologies remains low. We investigate whether the quality of agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up. Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that 30\\% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50\\% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are noisy, farmers{\rq} ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not fully collapsed. }},

We find that ratings-based guidelines are widespread, but their forms and motivations vary considerably. The usage of ratings appears remarkably similar in the US and Europe. The adoption of ratings-based investment guidelines appears driven by the private sector, with regulation playing a relatively minor role. Guidelines generally reference ratings of specific agencies, rather than the ratings of all officially {\textquotedblleft}recognized{\textquotedblright} agencies. Ratings-based guidelines seem unlikely to destabilize markets because although asset retention guidelines are common, rapid forced selling upon downgrades is not. Market participants express a preference on the margin for more accuracy over more stability, but stability is valued and guidelines rarely include agency outlook designations, which could be used to increase rating accuracy. These findings generally support the hypothesis presented in Cantor [2004] that ratings are used as governance tools by market participants to ameliorate principal-agent problems between asset managers and their clients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The collapse of AAA-rated structured finance products in 2007 to 2008 has brought renewed attention to conflicts of interest in credit rating agencies (CRAs). We model competition among CRAs with three sources of conflicts: (1) CRAs conflict of understating risk to attract business, (2) issuers' ability to purchase only the most favorable ratings, and (3) the trusting nature of some investor clienteles. These conflicts create two distortions. First, competition can reduce efficiency, as it facilitates ratings shopping. Second, ratings are more likely to be inflated during booms and when investors are more trusting. We also discuss efficiency-enhancing regulatory interventions.},

I find no decline in the performance of corporate credit ratings during or after the crisis, indicating that the failures of ratings on financial instruments were due to conditions unique to the rating agencies' financial instruments divisions. Rather, the preponderance of tests indicate that corporate credit rating performance improves after the crisis, consistent with the rating agencies positively responding to public criticism and regulatory pressures. At the same time, I find evidence of sophisticated market participants decreasing their reliance on corporate credit ratings after the crisis. Consistent with theoretical models of reputation cyclicality, a likely explanation is that the rating agencies suffer spillover reputation damage from their failed ratings on financial instruments. My study informs regulators, practitioners, and academics about the performance of corporate credit ratings during and after the crisis, and provides novel empirical evidence consistent with reputation concerns affecting credit rating usage decisions.}},

In our model, a high average rating indicates a high product quality, whereas a high variance of ratings is associated with a niche product, one that some consumers love and others hate. Based on its informational role, a higher variance would correspond to a higher subsequent demand if and only if the average rating is low. We find empirical evidence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions with book data from Amazon.com and BN.com. A higher standard deviation of ratings on Amazon improves a book's relative sales rank when the average rating is lower than 4.1 stars, which is true for 35\% of all the books in our sample.

In general, these recommender systems are based on two complementary techniques. Content-based systems match customer interests with information about the products, while collaborative systems utilize preference ratings from the other customers.

This paper aims to examine if expert ratings are suitable quality indicators for consumers and whether there are certain groups of consumers that find expert awards more useful than others.Design/methodology/approach- The paper compares German consumer ratings obtained in a sensory laboratory with German Agricultural Society's quality competition awards. it tests for the correspondence between expert and non‐expert ratings and for the concordance within the non‐expert group. Estimation of a linear mixed model serves to identify consumer‐side variables with an influence on individual rating distance.Findings- Correspondence between expert and non‐experts and concordance within the non‐expert group were found to be insignificant. Experienced wine consumers with sufficient specific knowledge and superior self‐reported sensory skills better replicated expert ratings.Research limitations/implications- With 216 wine ratings obtained from 36 German consumers, the number of observations is small. Future research should verify above findings by considering more consumers and the stability of ratings across time.Practical implications- The findings suggest that although some consumer segments may find expert awards to be useful decision cues, for a large portion of the market, there is demand for a more consumer‐orientated system of sensory quality evaluation and labelling.Originality/value- This paper is the first to address the usefulness of expert ratings to novice and experienced wine consumer populations. The statistical procedures employed (including linear mixed modelling) are shown to be useful techniques to handle the repeated measurement nature of the data.},

In this paper, we show that in many cases such an approach is problematic. By design, non-linear models inherently include interactions, and as a result the interaction coefficient does not capture the full extent and complexity of the interaction effect. After exploring the complexities of interaction effects in non-linear models, we outline methods to estimate and understand the interaction effects in two widely used marketing models. We use 26years of weekly US movie market data to test the interactions between critics' ratings and consumer sentiment about economic conditions on box office attendance. In addition to finding that movie attendance is counter-cyclical, an expected but not previously documented result, we also show, contrary to popular belief, that critics' ratings have larger impact during economic downturns than during periods of economic expansion.},

  abstract = {We study how user-generated content (UGC) about new products impacts a firm's advertising and pricing decisions and the effect on profits and market dynamics. We construct a two-period model where consumers value quality and are heterogeneous in their taste for the new product's positioning and examine three information-transfer structures across generations: no information (benchmark), average rating (AR), and the joint distribution of ratings and taste locations (reviews). First, we show that in the AR case, the firm advertises to a smaller set of consumers and prices higher relative to the other cases. This occurs because the firm has an incentive to use advertising strategically to bump up the first-generation average rating in order to increase second-generation quality perceptions. The firm charges a higher first-period price as consumers who are relatively close to the product's location are advertised to. Second, we find that as more information is transferred across generations, there is a greater likelihood that average ratings will exhibit an increasing pattern over time. This happens because with reviews, second-generation consumers are able to base purchase decisions on the product's positioning in addition to its quality. Interestingly, because of the firm's narrower advertising strategy in the AR case and the richer UGC in the reviews case, average ratings will exhibit a reversal over time: higher in the AR case in the first period but higher in the reviews case in the second period. Third, a firm's expected profits can exhibit a nonmonotonic relationship with respect to the amount of UGC transferred: highest in the AR case if the marginal return on advertising is high (e.g., when advertising is cheap to execute, consumers are insensitive to product fit or consumers greatly value quality) but highest in the reviews case when the return on advertising is low. We then examine a setup whereby second-generation consumers become aware of the product through social interaction with first-generation buyers. We find that advertising and social contagion interact: the firm generally has a greater incentive to advertise as homophily increases, that is, as social interactions occur between consumers who more likely share similar preferences. However, this pattern can reverse with reviews. This paper discusses several robustness checks and model extensions and concludes by highlighting the managerial implications of the results.This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing.},

  abstract = {This paper explores whether and how a firm should adapt its strategy in view of consumer use of prior customer ratings. Specifically, we consider optimal pricing and whether the firm should offer an unexpected frill to early customers to enhance their product experiences. We show that if price history is unobserved by consumers, a forward-looking firm should always modify its strategy from single-period optimal one, but it may be optimal to do so by lowering price, by lowering price and offering frills, or by raising price and offering frills, depending on the market growth rate. Specifically, the last strategy becomes optimal when market growth rate is high enough. The results are similar when the price history is observed by consumers, except that no deviation from single-period profit maximization choices is optimal when market growth is low enough. We also analyze whether the firm should prefer that the price information be stated in or left out of consumer reviews. In addition, in considering the effects of consumer heterogeneity, we conclude that the optimal firm's effort to affect ratings is higher when the idiosyncratic part of consumer uncertainty is larger.},

The word peer in the expression peer ratings has two distinct but interrelated meanings. It is used to refer to both a source of information that is used to create a set of measures and the phenomena that these measures are intended to index. To put it succinctly, the expression peer ratings refers to measures based on peer reports that tell us about what goes on in children's and adolescents' experiences within the peer group. Most studies of peer relations use peer ratings in one form or another. Their pervasive and indispensable role in peer research justifies the inclusion of a chapter on peer ratings in handbooks of developmental methods (e.g., Thompson, 1960).

Recent studies measured learning at two-time points. When learning was measured with a test at the end of the course, the teachers who got the highest ratings were the ones who contributed the most to learning. But when learning was measured as performance in subsequent related courses, the teachers who had received relatively low ratings appeared to have been most effective. We speculate about why these effects occurred: making a course difficult in productive ways may decrease ratings but enhance learning. Despite their limitations, we do not suggest abandoning student ratings, but do recommend that student evaluation scores should not be the sole basis for evaluating college teaching and they should be recognized for what they are.},

Classrooms with higher concentrations of minority, poor, and low‐achieving students were more likely to be taught by teachers with lower evaluation scores. Two‐level multilevel models, nesting students within classrooms, tended to show higher mean achievement in classrooms taught by teachers of higher than lower quality, with differences of approximately one‐tenth of 1 standard deviation. Findings relating teacher quality to closing within‐classroom achievement gaps, though, were mixed.

Convergent and discriminant validity were tested by analyzing a multitrait-multimethod matrix via confirmatory factor analysis. Convergence between mothers and fathers was satisfactory, while convergence between child and parents was significant, but fairly low. Discriminant validity was sufficiently supported, whereas informant-specific error was related to both child and father ratings. Criterion validity of the parenting dimension with regard to child behavior was established. Overall, behavioral control and support were positively associated with child prosocial behavior, while psychological control was positively correlated with child conduct problems, and to a lesser extent with child internalizing problems.

Yet factors leading to functional impairment, above and beyond the severity of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, have not been systematically examined. This study examined a model suggesting that after controlling for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom severity, child temperament is uniquely associated with parenting stress; that parenting stress affects parenting style, above and beyond child characteristics; that parenting style is related to the level of child impairment, above and beyond the effects of child symptoms, temperament, and parenting stress; and finally that parenting style moderates the relationship between ADHD symptom severity and child functioning. Child measures included parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptom severity, teacher-rated temperament, and clinician-rated functioning in a sample of 138 inattentive/hyperactive preschoolers. Maternal self-ratings of parenting style and parenting stress were obtained. Analyses indicated that, after controlling for symptom severity, child temperament was related to maternal parenting stress, which was additionally related to both maternal parenting style and child functioning. Maternal positive parenting style moderated the relationship between ADHD symptom severity and child impairment, indicating that a positive parenting style plays a protective role in the functioning of hyperactive/inattentive preschoolers.

Imageability ratings are used extensively in psycholinguistic, neuropsychological, and aphasiological studies. However, little formal knowledge exists about whether and how these ratings are associated between and within languages. Fifteen imageability databases were cross-correlated using nonparametric statistics. Some of these corresponded to unpublished data collected within a European research network--the Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists (COST IS1208). All but four of the correlations were significant. The average strength of the correlations (rho = .68) and the variance explained (R2 = 46%) were moderate. This implies that factors other than imageability may explain 54% of the results. Imageability ratings often correlate across languages. Different possibly interacting factors may explain the moderate strength and variance explained in the correlations: (1) linguistic and cultural factors; (2) intrinsic differences between the databases; (3) range effects; (4) small numbers of words in each database, equivalent words, and participants; and (5) mean age of the participants. The results suggest that imageability ratings may be used cross-linguistically. However, further understanding of the factors explaining the variance in the correlations will be needed before research and practical recommendations can be made.},

  abstract = {This study tests the influence of acoustic cues and non-acoustic contextual factors on listeners’ perception of prominence in three languages whose prominence systems differ in the phonological patterning of prominence and in the association of prominence with information structure—English, French and Spanish. Native speakers of each language performed an auditory rating task to mark prominent words in samples of conversational speech under two instructions: with prominence defined in terms of acoustic or meaning-related criteria. Logistic regression models tested the role of task instruction, acoustic cues and non-acoustic contextual factors in predicting binary prominence ratings of individual listeners. In all three languages we find similar effects of prosodic phrase structure and acoustic cues (F0, intensity, phone-rate) on prominence ratings, and differences in the effect of word frequency and instruction. In English, where phrasal prominence is used to convey meaning related to information structure, acoustic and meaning criteria converge on very similar prominence ratings. In French and Spanish, where prominence plays a lesser role in signaling information structure, phrasal prominence is perceived more narrowly on structural and acoustic grounds. Prominence ratings from untrained listeners correspond with ToBI pitch accent labels for each language. Distinctions in ToBI pitch accent status (nuclear, prenuclear, unaccented) are reflected in empirical and model-predicted prominence ratings. In addition, words with a ToBI pitch accent type that is typically associated with contrastive focus are more likely to be rated as prominent in Spanish and English, but no such effect is found for French. These findings are discussed in relation to probabilistic models of prominence production and perception.},

Sensitivity to perceiving negative evaluation in faces (i.e., emotion detection) was assessed at both long (unlimited) and brief (60ms) stimulus durations. In addition, ratings of perceived social cost were made indicating what participants judged it would be like to have a social interaction with a person exhibiting the stimulus emotion. Results suggest that high social anxiety participants did not demonstrate biases in their sensitivity to perceiving negative evaluation (i.e. disgust) in facial expressions. However, high social anxiety participants did estimate the perceived cost of interacting with someone showing disgust to be significantly greater than low social anxiety participants, regardless of the intensity of the disgust expression. These results are consistent with a specific type of interpretation bias in which participants with social anxiety have elevated ratings of the social cost of interacting with individuals displaying negative evaluation.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACTThis study investigated the psychometric properties of the Elementary Social Behaviour Assessment (ESBA), a teacher-report measure of students’ social skills and academic engagement adapted for use in Norwegian schools. At two times, 8 weeks apart, 151 teachers rated 793 students in Grades 1–6 on the ESBA and the Social Skills Rating System Teacher’s form (SSRS-T). Exploratory factor analysis with the first assessment suggested one or possibly two factors. Confirmatory factor analysis with the second assessment confirmed the one- or two-factor models but did not offer strong evidence for one over the other. The ESBA demonstrated good to excellent reliability. Strong concurrent and predictive correlations with the SSRS-T established criterion validity. The school and teacher levels explained only a limited amount of the total variance in ESBA scores, suggesting that teachers rate students quite similarly. The Norwegian-adapted ESBA paralleled the reliability and validity evidence from US samples.},

  abstract = {A gendered mapping of the structure and coordination (functioning) of traditional cassava value chains is important for marginalized groups such as women in rural development. In contrast to global high value chains, traditional food value chains and associated gender relations as well as power dynamics within households have received little attention. We conducted a cross sectional study in Kigoma, Mwanza, the coastal region, and Zanzibar Island in Tanzania. Data were collected through structured interviews conducted with 228 farmers, combined with key informant interviews, direct observations, repeated household visits, and literature review. The results of the study revealed that there are weak linkages within the cassava value chain, which is highly gendered. While production and processing nodes of the chain, which commenced from villages, were dominated by women and children, women were not well-integrated within high value nodes such as marketing in urban areas and cross-border trading, which were dominated by men. Transportation of cassava to highly lucrative markets was also dominated by men. Cassava processing was conducted at the household level as well as within small-scale cooperatives, with the major portion of this work being done by women. Supporting institutions were found to be involved in the supply of planting material, training, and the provision of processing equipment. In general, men played a prominent role in the control of resources, marketing, and income. In conclusion, the mapping of cassava value chains could help to identify avenues for understanding of poverty, enhancing food security, upgrading capacities, reducing gender inequality, and enhancing women's participation in marketing and income control in the cassava value chains.},

  abstract = {Although aquaculture is the fastest growing food producing sector in the world and generates significant employment opportunities at multiple scales, men and women are not necessarily able to participate in aquaculture value chains in the same way, and benefits may not be evenly distributed between them. This paper aims to elucidate current knowledge of gendered engagement in and returns from aquaculture value chains. It does so by presenting a review of existing evidence on gender issues in aquaculture value chains along five key dimensions: gender division of labor, distribution of benefits, access and control over assets and resources, gender and social norms, power relations and governance. Subsequently, the potential results for value chain performance and potential upgrading pathways are presented. The review shows that there is limited high quality sex-disaggregated data regarding aquaculture value chains, in particular related to the distribution of benefits in the chain. It also shows that evidence is limited regarding other aspects of the quality of women's participation in and returns from these chains. Existing evidence, however, indicates gendered imbalances in all five dimensions assessed, with formal and informal barriers, including gender norms, limiting women's equal engagement and returns. The specifics were found to vary by context and to be shaped in relation to factors such as class, needs, and social and religious norms. The impact of gender inequity on value chain performance was also found to be an area of literature for which evidence is still limited. While the upgrading pathways as described in the literature may result in economic upgrading, they may have limited effect on improving inequity or social conditions in the chain, if they do not take underlying inequities in institutions into account. Together the evidence indicates the need for research to elucidate practical ways to increase women's engagement in and returns from aquaculture value chains through addressing formal and informal barriers to women's control over assets, including shifting underlying gender norms and relations towards gender equality.},

This study investigated the gender influence on preferred food and cash crops, as well as upgrading strategies in sub-humid Kilosa and semi-arid Chamwino Districts, Tanzania. A mixed methods research design was used to collect information from 595 respondents, while content analysis was used to qualitatively analyze qualitative data obtained from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Our findings show that farmers from Kilosa and Chamwino had no differences with respect to preferences expressed by men and women for their first priority cash. Gender differences for choices were evident in relation to the second priority, food crops, in the semi-arid area and the third priority, which was also food crops in the sub-humid area, where women and youth differed from men on their views toward maize versus sorghum in the semi-arid region. Here, youth differed from women and men in how they viewed cassava versus rice. For upgrading strategies, which were only conducted with the first priority crops, most of the strategies preferred by men differed from those preferred by women and youth. In both areas, youth and women preferred upgrading strategies related to crop harvesting, transportation and primary processing, whereas men preferred upgrading strategies for farm inputs and crop marketing. Therefore, it is recommended that site-specific gendered analysis on upgrading strategies in agricultural value chains should be completed prior to introducing an intervention.},

This commentary offers a theoretical and practical critique of the GR4A model, drawing on early findings from a five-year study of value chain initiatives in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Mozambique. It highlights the limitations of a model that views heightened market interactions as uniformly beneficial for smallholder farmers. We challenge the notion that there is a broadly similar and replicable process for the construction of markets and the development of gender-sensitive value chains in all recipient countries. Instead we build upon the feminist network political ecology and coproduction literatures to conceptualise value chains as complex assemblages co-produced by a broad set of actors, including socially differentiated farmers.},

A total of 184 adult working participants completed a three-part questionnaire that measured their ‘big five’ personality traits (NEO-FFI), various beliefs about intelligence and also their own and their boss's estimated overall IQ score and scores on eight multiple business intelligences. Males rated their overall IQ as well as their cognitive, creative and political intelligence as significantly higher than females. Females rated their boss's overall, emotional and organizational IQ significantly higher than did male participants. Participants believed they had higher emotional, but lower political, organizational and network intelligence than their boss. Regressions indicated that only one of the eight estimated business intelligences (cognitive intelligence) was related to overall (total, general) estimated intelligence in self, boss or boss's boss. Regressing the big-five personality factors onto each of the self-estimates showed openness-to-experience was positively, and agreeableness negatively, related to most of the estimates. Those who had taken an intelligence test tended to giver higher self-estimates on overall intelligence. Implications of these results for business life are considered.},

In total, a usable response of 66 general managers (the superiors) and 66 rooms and 66 food and beverage managers (the subordinates) from 66 hotels and resorts were received. The results of the study revealed significant differences between (i) the general managers’ (GMs’) ratings of their department managers’ (DMs’) performance and (ii) the DMs’ self-ratings of their performance.

One or more people who knew the focal participant well (n = 2445) rated the focal participant's problematic smartphone use. People rated their own smartphone use as more problematic than did others. Self- and other-ratings of problematic smartphone use correlated 0.38. The pattern of self-other and other-other correlations indicated that self-ratings were more accurate than other-ratings. The pattern of high neuroticism and low conscientiousness predicting greater problematic smartphone use was observed for both self- and other-ratings. Findings suggest that self-report measures are reasonably valid, problematic smartphone usage is observable, and the relationship between personality and problematic smartphone use is robust.},

An alternative possibility is that self-deception evolved as an interpersonal strategy to persuade others. To investigate interpersonal aspects of self-deception, we gave people a persuasive task and measured their information processing biases and their persuasiveness. Results revealed that people who were financially motivated to persuade another person in a particular direction demonstrated a self-deceptive information processing bias consistent with their persuasive goals. This information processing bias led people to convince themselves of the veracity of their persuasive goal, and subsequently to be more persuasive to others. These findings suggest that self-deception has interpersonal benefits that offset its costs.},

We argue that the self serves as a stable anchor across different forms of judgment and that referring a stimulus to ourselves enhances the binding of stimulus features at different stages of processing (e.g., in perception and in memory) and also the binding between processing stages. There is neural evidence that self-biases reflect an underlying neural network that interacts with but is independent of attentional control networks in the brain, and that damage to the self-related network disrupts the bias effects.

Furthermore, to render these distinctions intuitive, we draw an extended analogy between self-enhancement and the phenomenon of eating. Among the topics we address are (a) manifestations of self-enhancement, both obvious and subtle, and rival interpretations; (b) experimentally documented dynamics of affirming and threatening the ego; and (c) primacy of self-enhancement, considered alongside other intrapsychic phenomena, and across different cultures.

  abstract  = {We define self-enhancement and self-protection as interests that individuals have in advancing one or more self-domains or defending against negative self-views. We review ways in which people pursue self-enhancement and self-protection, discuss the role of these motivational constructs in scientific explanations, argue for their importance in maintaining psychological and physical well-being, and consider the conditions in which they are likely to operate. At various points, we address the perennial “cognition–motivation” debate. We argue that, despite the conceptual and practical difficulties that attend this distinction, the pervasiveness of the self-enhancement and self-protection motives makes it impossible and imprudent to ignore them in explaining self-related findings and theories.},

  abstract  = {This chapter discusses 3 basic issues concerning self-enhancement bias and its relevance to organizational issues. First, we discuss the nature of the self-enhancement process. We describe several psychological mechanisms presumed to underlie the process and argue that self-enhancement is not a universal phenomenon. Second, we review the literature on individual differences in self-enhancement and identify several variants, including impression management and self-deceptive enhancement and denial. We argue that the underlying personality of the self-ehancer (and self-deceptive enhancement in particular) is equivalent to so-called "normal narcissism"--a character syndrome that includes grandiosity, entitlement, defensiveness, and a willingness to manipulate others. Third, we discuss whether it is adaptive to self-enhance, that is, whether self-enhancers make good employees. We argue that self-enhancement is best viewed as a trait with mixed blessings, entailing both costs and benefits to the individual and to the organization.

These words, along with 125 others (Rubin, 1981), were then rated by additional groups of 62-76 college students on 5-point rating scales for the dimensions of pleasantness, imagery, and familiarity. The resulting mean ratings were highly correlated with the ratings obtained by other investigators using some of the same words. However, systematic differences in the ratings were found for male versus female raters. Females tended to use more extreme ratings than did males when rating words on the pleasantness scale. Also, females tended to rate words higher on the imagery and familiarity scales. Whether these sex differences in ratings represent cognitive differences between the sexes or merely differences in response style is a question that can be determined only by further research.},

In the first study, discriminant analyses of the evaluative ratings (n=248) of 35 meals and snacks yielded significant gender and age differences on the pleasure and health dimensions. Separate factor analyses of the pleasure and health ratings revealed that males and females grouped foods differently on these criteria. The factor analysis of convenience ratings suggested that males and females perceive the meaning of convenience differently. In the second study, 336 college students rated 27 meals on the three evaluative dimensions and also indicated their preferences for each meal. Multiple regression analyses showed that preferences could be significantly predicted, and other results showed that as compared to males, females give higher health, pleasure and convenience ratings to healthy meals. The third study employed a modified free association technique to investigate gender and age differences in the meanings of nine familiar foods. Data from 96 males and females aged 18 to 86 revealed a substantial variety of significant age and gender differences for specific foods. It is suggested that taken together, these results indicate important cognitive and affective sources for gender and age-related food attitudes.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study investigated leniency and similar-to-me bias as mechanisms underlying demographic subgroup differences among assessees in assessors’ initial dimension ratings from three assessment center (AC) simulation exercises used as part of high-stakes promotional testing. It examined whether even small individual-level effects can accumulate (i.e., “trickle-up”) to produce larger subgroup-level differences. Individual-level analyses were conducted using cross-classified multilevel modeling and conducted separately for each exercise. Results demonstrated weak evidence of leniency toward White assessees and similar-to-me bias among non-White assessee–assessor pairs. Similar leniency was found toward female assessees, but no statistically significant effects were found for assessee or assessor gender or assessee–assessor gender similarity. Using traditional d effect size estimates, weak individual level assessee effects translated into small but consistent subgroup differences favoring White and female assessees. Generally small but less consistent subgroup differences indicated that non-White and male assessors gave higher ratings. Moreover, analyses of overall promotion decisions indicate the absence of adverse impact. Findings from this AC provide some support for the “trickle-up” effect, but the effect on subgroup differences is trivial. The results counter recent reviews of AC studies suggesting larger than previously assumed subgroup differences. Consequently, the findings demonstrate the importance of following established best practices when developing and implementing the AC method for selection purposes to minimize subgroup differences.},

However, interpretational ambiguities make it impossible to determine whether these gender differences are due to the operation of biases. The present research investigated whether gender differences in biased self-perceptions exist by assessing the accuracy of posttask self-evaluations of performance. In accordance with self-consistency theory, it was hypothesized that Ss' expectancies affect their posttask self-evaluations. For example, men who generally have high expectancies on masculine-gender-typed tasks were hypothesized to evidence overly positive self-evaluations. Women, who generally hold low expectancies on masculine tasks, were hypothesized to hold overly negative self-evaluations. Results confirmed that self-consistency tendencies can partially explain self-perception biases. The implications of these findings for women's achievement behavior and self-confidence are discussed.

  abstract = {The effect of measurement conditions on the psychometric properties of selfassessment was investigated in a selection context. Two experimental studies are reported which investigated the effect of format and instructions on leniency and halo. In Study 1 it was hypothesized that questionnaires based on overall descriptions of competencies and asking for examples of past behaviour would display less leniency and halo than when raters did not provide such evidence, or when the competency was broken down into its behavioural elements. The effect of social comparison instructions (SCI) was also explored. Participants were 738 candidates who applied to join a public sector organization. Contrary to predictions, it was found that questionnaires based on ‘behavioural elements’ displayed less leniency. Furthermore, an interaction between format and instructions was found; questionnaires based on behavioural elements/no SCI showed less leniency than ‘competencies/no SCI’ and ‘competencies/evidence/SCI’. No significant findings were obtained for halo. Study 2 used a subset of 224 candidates from Study 1 who attended the next stage of the selection process. It was hypothesized that unbalanced, positively toned scales would show less leniency and halo than conventional scales, as would instructions requesting a realistic self-assessment of the individuals' strengths and weaknesses. The first hypothesis was supported. A trend towards lower leniency was observed for ‘honesty’ instructions, which failed to reach significance. Gender differences were observed such that males were significantly less lenient when dimensional questionnaires were employed (Study 1), and unbalanced questionnaires and instructions pertaining to realism (Study 2). Females' self-assessment displayed less leniency and halo when unbalanced questionnaires were employed. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for practice.},

Ss completed a group cohesiveness and a projected group learning scale and self-report measures rating Ss' enjoyment of the exercise, value and usefulness of the exercise for them, and their own level of participation in the exercise. Observational ratings were made on the groups for 5 variables, including task orientation, group mood, group interaction, self-disclosure, and exercise length. Findings indicate that members of the all-female and mixed sex-groups rated themselves significantly higher on cohesiveness than did members of the all-male groups. The mixed-sex groups also rated themselves as participating more and their groups as being more valuable and useful than did the all-male groups. The all-male and the mixed-sex groups were rated as significantly more task oriented than the all-female groups; however, the all-female groups were rated as having a significantly brighter mood than the all-male groups. Results suggest that sexually heterogeneous groups possess significant advantages for both sexes over all-male or all-female groups.

The first study collected data from 233 management students on the difficulty of rating different characteristics. It also developed reliable measures of self-protection mechanisms that may negatively influence self-awareness. Four self-protection factors were identified: Denial, Giving Up, Self-Promotion, and Fear of Failure. The second study collected self-, supervisor, peer, and subordinate ratings of the managerial characteristics to derive multiple measures of self-awareness. There was a total of 283 co-worker ratings for 36 target middle managers. The results showed that within-sample co-worker disagreement measures from Study 2 were higher for items that were perceived by the sample in Study 1 as more difficult to rate. Self-ratings were more highly related to the average of co-worker ratings than to the ratings provided by any one co-worker alone. Co-workers' ratings of the target's use of self-protection mechanisms were negatively associated with self-awareness measures. Ideas are discussed for other correlates of self-awareness and ways to enhance the value of feedback processes.},
