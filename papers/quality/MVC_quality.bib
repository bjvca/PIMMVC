	abstract = { Improved maize seed is instrumental to deliver an Asian-style {\lq}green revolution{\rq} for Africa. The paper reviews and makes a comparative analysis of the maize (corn) seed sector and its evolution in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia drawing from seed sector surveys and secondary data. Enhancing farmers{\rq} access to and use of new maize varieties still presents a number of challenges in eastern Africa -- not least due to a number of policy and institutional impediments to the development of the seed sector. The regional seed sectors also show some remarkable contrasts: they have evolved at different speeds and in different directions, driven by diverging agricultural growth opportunities and varying degrees of regulation, liberalization and restructuring. The paper reiterates calls for an enabling environment for private seed companies to evolve in order to serve the diverse farmer communities so that they benefit from existing and future improved maize seed opportunities. },

	abstract = {Abstract In this article we address the question of farm--nonfarm linkages at the household level in Senegal. We examine whether increasing off-farm employment opportunities for rural households---resulting from increased horticulture exports and associated agro-industrialization---has benefitted the smallholder farm sector through investment linkages. We use data from a household survey in the main horticulture export region in Senegal. We find that access to unskilled employment in the export agro-industry has contributed to the alleviation of farmers' liquidity constraints, resulting in increased smallholder agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid growth of cities in Africa, more rural farmers are providing staple foods to urban residents. However, empirical evidence on how urbanization affects these farmers is scarce. To fill this gap, this paper explores the relationship between proximity to a city and the production behavior of rural staple crop producers. More in particular, we analyze data from teff producing farmers in major producing areas around Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. We find that farmers more closely located to Addis Ababa face higher wages, land rental rates, and teff prices, leading to better incentives to intensify production as seen in the uptake of modern inputs. Moreover, we observe that land and labor productivity as well as profitability in teff production improve with urban proximity. Our results suggest that better connectivity of rural farmers to cities and growing urban demand for food are important associates of the process of agricultural intensification and transformation in Ethiopia.},
